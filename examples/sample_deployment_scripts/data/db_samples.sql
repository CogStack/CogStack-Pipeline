He has a past history of known hyperthyroidism since 1992 and a more recent history of atrial fibrillation and congestive cardiac failure with an ejection fraction of 20%-25%. The main cause for his shortness of breath was believed to be due to atrial fibrillation secondary to hyperthyroidism in a setting with congestive cardiac failure. During his hospital stay, he was commenced on metoprolol for rate control, and given that he had atrial fibrillation, he was also started on warfarin, which his INR has been followed up by the Homeless Clinic. For his congestive cardiac failure, he was restarted on Digoxin and lisinopril. For his hyperthyroidism, we restarted him on PTU and the endocrinologists were happy to review him when he was euthymic to discuss further radioiodine or radiotherapy. He was restarted on PTU and discharged from the hospital on this medication. While in the hospital, it was also noted that he abused cigarettes and cocaine, and we advised strongly against this given the condition of his heart. It was also noted that he had elevated liver function tests, which an ultrasound was normal, but his hepatitis panel was pending. Since his discharge, his hepatitis panel has come back normal for hepatitis A, B, and C. Since discharge, the patient has complained of shortness of breath, mainly at night when lying flat, but otherwise he states he has been well and compliant with his medication.\n\nMEDICATIONS: Digoxin 250 mcg daily, lisinopril 5 mg daily, metoprolol 50 mg twice daily, PTU (propylthiouracil) 300 mg orally four times a day, warfarin variable dose based on INR.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nVITAL SIGNS: He was afebrile today. Blood pressure 114/98. Pulse 92 but irregular. Respiratory rate 25.\nHEENT: Obvious exophthalmus, but no obvious lid lag today.\nNECK: There was no thyroid mass palpable.\nCHEST: Clear except for occasional bibasilar crackles.\nCARDIOVASCULAR: Heart sounds were dual, but irregular, with no additional sounds.\nABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended.\nEXTREMITIES: Mild +1 peripheral edema in both legs.\n\nPLAN: The patient has also been attending the Homeless Clinic since discharge from the hospital, where he has been receiving quality care and they have been looking after every aspect of his health, including his hyperthyroidism. It is our recommendation that a TSH and T4 be continually checked until the patient is euthymic, at which time he should attend endocrine review with Dr. Huffman for further treatment of his hyperthyroidism. Regarding his atrial fibrillation, he is moderately rate controlled with metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d. His rate in clinic today was 92. He could benefit from increasing his metoprolol dose, however, in the hospital it was noted that he was bradycardic in the morning with a pulse rate down to the 50s, and we were concerned with making this patient bradycardic in the setting of congestive cardiac failure. Regarding his congestive cardiac failure, he currently appears stable, with some variation in his weight. He states he has been taking his wife's Lasix tablets for diuretic benefit when he feels weight gain coming on and increased edema. We should consider adding him on a low-dose furosemide tablet to be taken either daily or when his weight is above his target range. A Digoxin level has not been repeated since discharge, and we feel that this should be followed up. We have also increased his lisinopril to 5 mg daily, but the patient did not receive his script upon departing our clinic. Regarding his elevated liver function tests, we feel that these are very likely secondary to hepatic congestion secondary to congestive cardiac failure with a normal ultrasound and normal hepatitis panel, but yet the liver function tests should be followed up.

She comes in today in consultation from Dr. A for an ASCUS Pap smear.\n\nPap smear in November 2006 showed atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance.  She has a history of an abnormal Pap smear.  At that time, she was diagnosed with CIN 3 as well as vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia.  She underwent a cone biopsy that per her report was negative for any pathology.  She had no vulvar treatment at that time.  Since that time, she has had normal Pap smears.  She denies abnormal vaginal bleeding, discharge, or pain.  She uses Yaz for birth control.  She reports one sexual partner since 1994 and she is a nonsmoker.\n\nShe states that she has a tendency to have yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis.  She is also being evaluated for a possible interstitial cystitis because she gets frequent urinary tract infections.  She had a normal mammogram done in August 2006 and a history of perirectal condyloma that have been treated by Dr. B.  She also has a history of chlamydia when she was in college.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HX:  Depression.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HX:  None.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Lexapro 10 mg a day and Yaz.\n\nALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.\n\nOB HX:  Normal spontaneous vaginal delivery at term in 2001 and 2004, Abc weighed 8 pounds 7 ounces and Xyz weighed 10 pounds 5 ounces.\n\nFAMILY HX:  Maternal grandfather who had a MI which she reports is secondary to tobacco and alcohol use.  He currently has metastatic melanoma, mother with hypertension and depression, father with alcoholism.\n\nSOCIAL HX:  She is a public relations consultant.  She is a nonsmoker, drinks infrequent alcohol and does not use drugs.  She enjoys horseback riding and teaches jumping.\n\nPE:  VITALS: Height: 5 feet 6 inches.  Weight: 139 lb.  BMI: 22.4.  Blood Pressure: 102/58.  GENERAL: She is well-developed and well-nourished with normal habitus and no deformities.  She is alert and oriented to time, place, and person and her mood and affect is normal.  NECK: Without thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy.  LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  HEART: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.  BREASTS: Deferred.  ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, and nondistended.  There is no organomegaly or lymphadenopathy.  PELVIC: Normal external female genitalia.  Vulva, vagina, and urethra, within normal limits.  Cervix is status post cone biopsy; however, the transformation zone grossly appears normal and cervical discharge is clear and normal in appearance.  GC and chlamydia cultures as well as a repeat Pap smear were done.\n\nColposcopy is then performed without and with acetic acid.  This shows an entirely normal transformation zone, so no biopsies are taken.  An endocervical curettage is then performed with Cytobrush and curette and sent to pathology.  Colposcopy of the vulva is then performed again with acetic acid.  There is a thin strip of acetowhite epithelium located transversely on the clitoral hood that is less than a centimeter in diameter.  There are absolutely no abnormal vessels within this area.  The vulvar colposcopy is completely within normal limits.\n\nA/P:  ASCUS Pap smear with history of a cone biopsy in 1993 and normal followup.\n\nWe will check the results of the Pap smear, in addition we have ordered DNA testing for high-risk HPV.  We will check the results of the ECC.  She will return in two weeks for admin results.  If these are normal, she will need two normal Pap smears six months apart, and I think followup colposcopy for the vulvar changes.

Lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into the region of the anterior portion of the nasal septum.  Approximately 10 cc total was used.\n\nA #15 blade and the Freer elevator were used to help make a standard hemitransfixion incision.  A mucoperichondrial flap was carefully elevated, and the junction with the cartilaginous bony septum was separated with the Freer elevator.  The bony deflection was removed using Jansen-Middleton forceps.  The cartilaginous deflection was created by freeing up the inferior attachments to the cartilaginous septum, placing it more on the midline maxillary crest.  The initial incision was placed in its anatomical position and secured with a 4-0 nylon suture for stabilization effect.\n\nAttention then was directed toward the left side.  Lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected in the region of the anterior portion of the left middle turbinate and uncinate process and polyps.  Approximately 10 cc total was used.  The polyps were removed using the Richards essential shaver to help identify the middle turbinate and uncinate process better.  The uncinate process was removed systematically superiorly to inferiorly with back-biting forceps.  Next, the maxillary antrostomy was identified and expanded with the back-biting forceps and showed polypoid accumulation in the mucosal disease on its opening site.  The sinus linings were edematous but did not have any polyps in the inferior, lateral, or superior aspects.\n\nThe anterior and posterior ethmoid air cells were entered primarily and dissected with the Richards essential shaver followed by the use of a 30-degree endoscope and up-biting forceps for the superior and lateral dissection.  Bright mucosal disease and small polypoid accumulations were noted through the sinuses also.  The inferior turbinates had some polypoid changes on them also and showed marked mucosal irritation and hypertrophy.  The mucosal polypoid accumulations were cleared using the Richards essential shaver.  The turbinate was partially resected from mucosally but with good shape to it.  It was not desirable to remove it in its entirety.  Any obvious bleeding points along the edge were controlled with the suction Bovie apparatus.\n\nThe same procedure and findings were noted on the right side with 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine injected into the anterior portion of the right middle turbinate, polyps, and uncinate process; 10 cc total were used.  The polyps were removed.  The Richards essential shaver was used to allow better exposure of the uncinate process.  The uncinate process was removed superiorly to inferiorly with back-biting side-biting forceps.\n\nNext, a maxillary antrostomy was identified and expanded with the back-biting and side-biting forceps and showed all plate accumulations there also.  The anterior and posterior ethmoid air cells were then entered primarily and dissected with Richards essential shaver followed by the use of the 30-degree scope and up-biting forceps for the superior and lateral resection.  The inferior turbinates showed mucosal disease, polypoid accumulations, and changes.  These were removed using the Richards essential shaver followed by a submucosal resection of the hypertrophied portion of the turbinate.\n\nAny obvious bleeding points were controlled with the suction Bovie apparatus.  A thorough irrigation was then carried out in the nasal cavity, and Gelfilm packing was used to coat the linings in the middle meatal regions.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and returned to the recovery room in stable condition.

As you are well aware, she is a pleasant 50-year-old female who states she started having severe sinusitis about two to three months ago with facial discomfort, nasal congestion, eye pain, and postnasal drip symptoms.  She states she really has sinus problems, but this infection has been rather severe and she notes she has not had much improvement with antibiotics.  She had a CT of her paranasal sinuses identifying mild mucosal thickening of right paranasal sinuses with occlusion of the ostiomeatal complex on the right and turbinate hypertrophy was also noted when I reviewed the films and there is some minimal nasal septum deviation to the left.  She currently is not taking any medication for her sinuses.  She also has noted that she is having some problems with her balance and possible hearing loss or at least ear popping and fullness.  Her audiogram today demonstrated mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, normal tympanometry, and normal speech discrimination.  She has tried topical nasal corticosteroid therapy without much improvement.  She tried Allegra without much improvement and she believes the Allegra may have caused problems with balance to worsen.  She notes her dizziness to be much worse if she does quick positional changes such as head turning or sudden movements, no ear fullness, pressure, humming, buzzing or roaring noted in her ears.  She denies any previous history of sinus surgery or nasal injury.  She believes she has some degree of allergy symptoms.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Seasonal allergies, possible food allergies, chronic sinusitis, hypertension and history of weight change.  She is currently 180 pounds.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Lower extremity vein stripping, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Strong for heart disease and alcoholism.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  DynaCirc.\n\nALLERGIES:  Egg-based products cause hives.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient used to smoke cigarettes for about 20 years, one-half pack a day.  She currently does not, which was encouraged to continue.  She rarely drinks any alcohol-containing beverages.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: \nVITAL SIGNS:  Age 50, blood pressure is 136/74, pulse 84, temperature is 98.4, weight is 180 pounds, and height is 5 feet 3 inches.\nGENERAL:  The patient is healthy appearing; alert and oriented to person, place and time; responds appropriately; in no acute distress.\nHEAD:  Normocephalic.  No masses or lesions noted.\nFACE:  No facial tenderness or asymmetry noted.\nEYES:  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation bilaterally.  Extraocular movements are intact bilaterally.  No nystagmus.\nEARS:  During Hallpike examination, the patient did not become dizzy until she would be placed back into sitting in the upright position.  No nystagmus was appreciated; however, the patient did subjectively report dizziness, which was repeated twice.  No evidence of any orthostatic hypotension was noted during the exam.  Tympanic membranes were noted to be intact.  No signs of middle ear effusion or ear canal inflammation.\nNOSE:  The patient appears congested.  Turbinate hypertrophy is noted.  There are no signs of any acute sinusitis.  Septum is midline, slightly deviated to the left.\nTHROAT:  There is clear postnasal drip.  Oral hygiene is good.  No masses or lesions noted.  Both vocal cords move well to midline.\nNECK:  The neck is supple with no adenopathy or masses palpated.  The trachea is midline.  The thyroid gland is of normal size with no nodules.\nLUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheeze noted.\nHEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmur noted.\nNEUROLOGIC:  Facial nerve is intact bilaterally.  The remaining cranial nerves are intact without focal deficit.\n\nPROCEDURE:  Fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy identifying turbinate hypertrophy and nasal septum deviation to the left, more significant posteriorly.\n\nIMPRESSION:  \n1.  Probable increasing problems with allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis, both contributing to the patient's symptoms.\n2.  Subjective dizziness, etiology uncertain; however, consider positional vertigo versus vestibular neuronitis as possible ear causes of dizziness, cannot rule out systemic, central or medication or causes at this time.\n3.  Inferior turbinate hypertrophy.\n4.  Nasal septum deformity.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:  An ENG was ordered to evaluate vestibular function.  She was placed on Veramyst nasal spray two sprays each nostril daily and even twice daily if symptoms are worsening.  A Medrol Dosepak was prescribed as directed.  The patient was given instruction on use of nasal saline irrigation to be used twice daily and Clarinex 5 mg daily was recommended.  After the patients' ENG examination, we will see the patient back for further evaluation and treatment recommendations.  In light of the patient's atypical dizziness symptoms, I cannot rule out other pathology at this time, and I informed her if there are any acute changes or problems with regards to her balance or any other acute changes, which she attributes associated with her dizziness, she most likely should pursue an emergent visit to the emergency room.\n\nThank you for allowing me to participate with the care of your patient.

Please refer to chart for history and physical, as well as the medical records regarding his allergic reaction treatment at ABC Medical Center for further details and studies.  In summary, the patient had an acute event of perioral swelling, etiology uncertain, occurring on 05/03/2008 requiring transfer from ABC Medical Center to XYZ Medical Center due to a history of renal failure requiring dialysis and he was admitted and treated and felt that his allergy reaction was to Keflex, which was being used to treat a skin cellulitis dialysis shunt infection.  In summary, the patient states he has some problems with tolerating grass allergies, environmental and inhalant allergies occasionally, but has never had anaphylactic or angioedema reactions.  He currently is not taking any medication for allergies.  He is taking atenolol for blood pressure control.  No further problems have been noted upon his discharge and treatment, which included corticosteroid therapy and antihistamine therapy and monitoring.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History of urticaria, history of renal failure with hypertension possible source of renal failure, history of dialysis times 2 years and a history of hypertension.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  PermCath insertion times 3 and peritoneal dialysis.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Strong for heart disease, carcinoma, and a history of food allergies, and there is also a history of hypertension.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Atenolol, sodium bicarbonate, Lovaza, and Dialyvite.\n\nALLERGIES:  Heparin causing thrombocytopenia.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Denies tobacco or alcohol use.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  \nVITAL SIGNS:  Age 34, blood pressure 128/78, pulse 70, temperature is 97.8, weight is 207 pounds, and height is 5 feet 7 inches.\nGENERAL:  The patient is healthy appearing; alert and oriented to person, place and time; responds appropriately; in no acute distress.\nHEAD:  Normocephalic.  No masses or lesions noted.\nFACE:  No facial tenderness or asymmetry noted.\nEYES:  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation bilaterally.  Extraocular movements are intact bilaterally.\nEARS:  The tympanic membranes are intact bilaterally with a good light reflex.  The external auditory canals are clear with no lesions or masses noted.  Weber and Rinne tests are within normal limits.\nNOSE:  The nasal cavities are patent bilaterally.  The nasal septum is midline.  There are no nasal discharges.  No masses or lesions noted.\nTHROAT:  The oral mucosa appears healthy.  Dental hygiene is maintained well.  No oropharyngeal masses or lesions noted.  No postnasal drip noted.\nNECK:  The neck is supple with no adenopathy or masses palpated.  The trachea is midline.  The thyroid gland is of normal size with no nodules.\nNEUROLOGIC:  Facial nerve is intact bilaterally.  The remaining cranial nerves are intact without focal deficit.\nLUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheeze noted.\nHEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmur noted.\n\nIMPRESSION:  \n1.  Acute allergic reaction, etiology uncertain, however, suspicious for Keflex.\n2.  Renal failure requiring dialysis.\n3.  Hypertension.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:  RAST allergy testing for both food and environmental allergies was performed, and we will get the results back to the patient with further recommendations to follow.  If there is any specific food or inhalant allergen that is found to be quite high on the sensitivity scale, we would probably recommend the patient to avoid the offending agent to hold off on any further reactions.  At this point, I would recommend the patient stopping any further use of cephalosporin antibiotics, which may be the cause of his allergic reaction, and I would consider this an allergy.  Being on atenolol, the patient has a more difficult time treating acute anaphylaxis, but I do think this is medically necessary at this time and hopefully we can find specific causes for his allergic reactions.  An EpiPen was also prescribed in the event of acute angioedema or allergic reaction or sensation of impending allergic reaction and he is aware he needs to proceed directly to the emergency room for further evaluation and treatment recommendations after administration of an EpiPen.

As you are well aware, he is a pleasant 64-year-old gentleman who unfortunately is suffering from end-stage COPD, who required tracheostomy tube placement about three months ago when being treated for acute exacerbation of COPD and having difficulty coming off ventilatory support.  He now resides in an extended care facility with a capped tracheostomy tube, and he unfortunately states he has had not had to use the tracheostomy tube since his discharge and admission to the extended care facility.  He requires constant oxygen administration and has been having no problems with shortness of breath, worsening, requiring opening the tracheostomy tube site.  He states there has been some tenderness associated with the tracheostomy tube and difficulty with swallowing and he wishes to have it removed.  Apparently there is no history of any airway issues while sleeping or need for uncapping the tube and essentially the tube has just remained present for months capped in his neck.  No history of any previous tracheostomy tube insertion.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  COPD, history of hypercarbic hypoxemia, history of coronary artery disease, history of previous myocardial infarction, and history of liver cirrhosis secondary to alcohol use.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, cholecystectomy, appendectomy, hernia repair, and tracheostomy.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Strong for heart disease, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular accident.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Prevacid, folic acid, aspirin, morphine sulfate, Pulmicort, Risperdal, Colace, clonazepam, Lotrisone, Roxanol, Ambien, Zolpidem tartrate, simethicone, Robitussin, and prednisone.\n\nALLERGIES:  Nitroglycerin.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a 25-year-smoking history, which I believe is quite heavy and he has a significant alcohol use in the past.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  \nVITAL SIGNS:  Age 64, blood pressure is 110/78, pulse 96, and temperature is 98.6.\nGENERAL:  The patient was examined in his wheelchair, resting comfortably, in no acute distress.\nHEAD:  Normocephalic.  No masses or lesions noted.\nFACE:  No facial tenderness or asymmetry noted.\nEYES:  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation bilaterally.  Extraocular movements are intact bilaterally.\nEARS:  The tympanic membranes are intact bilaterally with a good light reflex.  The external auditory canals are clear with no lesions or masses noted.  Weber and Rinne tests are within normal limits.\nNOSE:  The nasal cavities are patent bilaterally.  The nasal septum is midline.  There are no nasal discharges.  No masses or lesions noted.\nTHROAT:  The oral mucosa appears healthy.  Dental hygiene is maintained well.  No oropharyngeal masses or lesions noted.  No postnasal drip noted.\nNECK:  The patient has a stable-appearing tracheostomy tube site and the stoma appears to be without signs of infection.  The previous incision was vertical in nature and there is no hypertrophic scar formation.  No adenopathy noted.  No stridor noted.\nNEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerve VII intact bilaterally.  No signs of tremor.\nLUNGS:  Diminished breath sounds in all four quadrants.  No wheezes noted.\nHEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.\n\nPROCEDURE:  Limited bronchoscopy and then fiberoptic laryngoscopy.\n\nIMPRESSION:  \n1.  End-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a history of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilatory support with tracheostomy tube placement.\n2.  Difficulty tolerating tracheostomy tubes secondary to swallow discomfort and neck irritation with no further need for tracheostomy tube over the past few months with the patient tolerating capped tracheostomy tube 24 hours a day.\n3.  History of coronary artery disease.\n4.  History of myocardial infarction.\n5.  History of cirrhosis of liver.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:  I discussed with the patient in detail after fiberoptic laryngoscopy and limited bronchoscopy was performed in the office whether or not to pull out the tracheostomy tube.  His vocal cords moved well, and I do not see any signs of granuloma or airway obstruction either in the supraglottic or subglottic region, and I felt he would tolerate the tube being removed with close monitoring by nursing at his extended care facility.  I did impress the fact that I believe he probably will have other events requiring airway support, which could include intubation, and if the intubation is prolonged a tracheostomy may be needed.  Creation of a long-term tracheostoma may be beneficial whereas the patient would not need such a long tracheostomy tube, and I informed the patient there are other options other than the tube he has at the present time.  The patient still wished to have the tube removed and he is aware he may need to have it replaced or he may have trouble with the area healing or scarring or he could end up having an emergent airway situation with the tube gone, but wishes to have it removed, and I did remove it today.  Dressing was applied and we will see him back next week to make sure everything is healing properly.

The patient is a difficult historian, does have a speech impediment, slow to answer questions, but daughter was able to answer lot of questions too.  He is complaining of no other pain.  He denies any abdominal pain.  Denies any bleeding anywhere else.  Denies any bruising.  He had an episode similar to this a year ago where it began the same with hematuria.  He was discharged after a workup in the hospital, in the emergency room, with Levaquin.  Three days later, he returned with a very large hematoma to his left neck and a coagulopathy with significant bleeding.  His H and H was down in the 6 level.  He received blood transfusions.  He was diagnosed with a malignancy, coagulopathy, and sounds like was in critical condition.  Family actually states that they were told that he was unlikely to live through that event, but he did.

This patient has been having what he described as numbness and tingling along the jaw, teeth, and tongue.  This numbness has been present for approximately two months.  It seems to be there &quot;all the time.&quot;  He was seen by his dentist and after dental evaluation was noted to be &quot;okay.&quot;  He had been diagnosed with a throat infection about a week ago and is finishing a course of Avelox at this time.  He has been taking cough drops and trying to increase his fluids.  He has recently stopped tobacco.  He has been chewing tobacco for about 30 years.  Again, there is concern regarding the numbness he has been having.  He has had a loss of sensation of taste as well.  Numbness seems to be limited just to the left lateral tongue and the jaw region and extends from the angle of the jaw to the lip.  He does report he has had about a 20-pound of weight gain over the winter, but notes he has had this in the past just simply from decreased activity.  He has had no trauma to the face.  He does note a history of headaches.  These are occasional and he gets these within the neck area when they do flare up.  The headaches are noted to be less than one or two times per month.  The patient does note he has a history of anxiety disorder as well.  He has tried to eliminate his amount of tobacco and he is actually taking Nicorette gum at this time.  He denies any fever or chills.  He is not having any dental pain with biting down.  He has had no jaw popping and no trismus noted.

This is primarily to evaluate and make sure there is not a neoplasm as the source of this numbness that he has had.  On the mucosal surface, I do not see any evidence of malignancy and no visible or palpable masses were noted.  I did recommend he increase his fluid intake.  He is to remain off the tobacco.  I have scheduled a recheck with me in the next two to three weeks to make further recommendations at that time.

Upper respiratory tract infection with mild acute laryngitis.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nHISTORY:  The patient is a 15-year-old female who was seen in consultation at the request of Dr. X on 05/15/2008 regarding enlarged tonsils.  The patient has been having difficult time with having two to three bouts of tonsillitis this year.  She does average about four bouts of tonsillitis per year for the past several years.  She notes that throat pain and fever with the actual infections.  She is having no difficulty with swallowing.  She does have loud snoring, though there have been no witnessed observed sleep apnea episodes.  She is a mouth breather at nighttime, however.  The patient does feel that she has a cold at today's visit.  She has had tonsil problems again for many years.  She does note a history of intermittent hoarseness as well.  This is particularly prominent with the current cold that she has had.  She had been seen by Dr. Y in Muskegon who had also recommended a tonsillectomy, but she reports she would like to get the surgery done here in the Ludington area as this is much closer to home.  For the two tonsillitis, she is on antibiotics again on an average about four times per year.  They do seem to help with the infections, but they tend to continue to recur.  The patient presents today for further workup, evaluation, and treatment of the above-listed symptoms.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\nALLERGY/IMMUNOLOGIC:  Negative.\nCARDIOVASCULAR:  Negative.\nPULMONARY:  Negative.\nGASTROINTESTINAL:  Negative.\nGENITOURINARY:  Negative.\nNEUROLOGIC:  Negative.\nVISUAL:  Negative.\nDERMATOLOGIC:  Negative.\nENDOCRINE:  Negative.\nMUSCULOSKELETAL:  Negative.\nCONSTITUTIONAL:  Negative.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Pertinent for previous cholecystectomy.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  No family history of bleeding disorder.

There is a malignant meningioma.  He is referred by Dr. X.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He said he has had two surgeries in 07/06 followed by radiation and then again in 08/07.  He then had a problem with seizures, hemiparesis, has been to the hospital, developed C-diff, and is in the nursing home currently.  He is unable to stand at the moment.  He is unable to care for himself. \n\nI reviewed the information that was sent down with him from the nursing home which includes his medical history.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Keppra 1500 twice a day and Decadron 6 mg four times a day.  His other medicines include oxycodone, an aspirin a day, Prilosec, Dilantin 300 a day, and Flagyl.\n\nFINDINGS:  On examination, he is lying on the stretcher.  He has oxygen on and has periods of spontaneous hyperventilation.  He is unable to lift his right arm or right leg.  He has an expressive dysphasia and confusion.\n\nI reviewed the imaging studies from summer from the beginning of 10/07, end of 10/07 as well as the current MRI he had last week.  This shows that he has had progression of disease with recurrence along the surface of the brain and there is significant brain edema.  This is a malignant meningioma by diagnosis.\n\nASSESSMENT/PLAN:  In summary, Mr. A has significant disability and is not independent currently.  I believe that because of this that the likelihood of benefit from surgery is small and there is a very good chance that he would not be able to recover from surgery.  I do not think that surgery will help his quality of life and a need to control the tumor would be dependent on another therapy impacting the tumor.  Given that there are not good therapies and chemotherapy would be the option at the moment, and he certainly is not in a condition where chemotherapy would be given, I believe that surgery would not be in his best interest.  I discussed this both with him, although it is not clear to me how much he understood, as well as his family.

She follows up at the wound care center at Hospital.  Her lower extremity edema is being managed there.  She has had multiple episodes of cellulitis of the lower extremities for which she has received treatment with oral Bactrim and ciprofloxacin in the past according to her.  As her lymphedema was not improving on therapy at that facility, she was referred for admission to Long-Term Acute Care Facility for lymphedema management.  She at present has a stage II ulcer on the lower part of the medial aspect of left leg without any drainage and has slight erythema of bilateral lower calf and shin areas.  Her measurements for lymphedema wraps have been taken and in my opinion, it is going to be started in a day or two.\n\nI have been consulted to rule out the possibility of lower extremity cellulitis that may require antibiotic therapy.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Positive for morbid obesity, chronic lymphedema of the lower extremities, at least for the last three years, spastic colon, knee arthritis, recurrent cellulitis of the lower extremities.  She has had a hysterectomy and a cholecystectomy in the remote past.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives by herself and has three pet cats.  She is an ex-smoker, quit smoking about five years ago.  She occasionally drinks a glass of wine.  She denies any other recreational drugs use.  She recently retired from State of Pennsylvania as a psychiatric aide after 32 years of service.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for mother passing away at the age of 38 from heart problems and alcoholism, dad passed away at the age of 75 from leukemia.  One of her uncles was diagnosed with leukemia.\n\nALLERGIES:  ADHESIVE TAPE ALLERGIES.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  At present, the patient is admitted with a nonresolving bilateral lower extremity lymphedema, which is a little bit more marked on the right lower extremity compared to the left.  She denies any nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.  She denies any pain, tenderness, increased warmth or drainage from the lower extremities.  Denies chest pain, cough or phlegm production.  All other systems reviewed were negative.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nGeneral:  A 51-year-old morbidly obese Caucasian female who is not in any acute hemodynamic distress at present.\nVital signs:  Her maximum recorded temperature since admission today is 96.8, pulse is 65 per minute, respiratory rate is 18 to 20 per minute, blood pressure is 150/54, I do not see a recorded weight at present.\nHEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Head is normocephalic and external ear exam is normal.\nNeck:  Supple.  There is no palpable lymphadenopathy.\nCardiovascular system:  Regular rate and rhythm of the heart without any appreciable murmur, rub or gallop.  Heart sounds are little distant secondary to thick chest wall.\nLungs:  Clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally.\nAbdomen:  Morbidly obese, soft, nontender, nondistended, there is no percussible organomegaly, there is no evidence of lymphedema on the abdominal pannus.  There is no evidence of cutaneous candidiasis in the inguinal folds.  There is no palpable lymphadenopathy in the inguinal and femoral areas.\nExtremities:  Bilateral lower extremities with evidence of extensive lymphedema, there is slight pinkish discoloration of the lower part of calf and shin areas, most likely secondary to stasis dermatosis.  There is no increased warmth or tenderness, there is no skin breakdown except a stage II chronic ulcer on the lower medial aspect of the right calf area.  It has minimal serosanguineous drainage and there is no surrounding erythema.  Therefore, in my opinion, there is no current evidence of cellulitis or wound infection.  There is no cyanosis or clubbing.  There is no peripheral stigmata of endocarditis.\nCentral nervous system:  The patient is alert and oriented x3, cranial nerves II through XII are intact, and there is no focal deficit appreciated.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  White cell count is 7.4, hemoglobin 12.9, hematocrit 39, platelet count of 313,000, differential is normal with 51% neutrophils, 37% lymphocytes, 9% monocytes and 3% eosinophils.  The basic electrolyte panel is within normal limits and the renal function is normal with BUN of 17 and creatinine of 0.5.  Liver function tests are also within normal limits.\n\nThe nasal screen for MRSA is negative.  Urine culture is negative so far from admission.  Urinalysis was negative for pyuria, leucocyte esterase, and nitrites.\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  A 51-year-old Caucasian female with multiple medical problems mentioned above including history of morbid obesity and chronic lower extremity lymphedema.  Admitted for inpatient management of bilateral lower extremity lymphedema.  I have been consulted to rule out possibility of active cellulitis and wound infection.\n\nAt present, I do not find evidence of active cellulitis that needs antibiotic therapy.  In my opinion, lymphedema wraps could be initiated.  We will continue to monitor her legs with lymphedema wraps changes 2 to 3 times a week.  If she develops any cellulitis, then appropriate antibiotic therapy will be initiated. \n\nHer stage II ulcer on the right leg does not look infected.  I would recommend continuation of wound care along with lymphedema wraps.\n\nOther medical problems will continue to be followed and treated by Dr. X's group during this hospitalization.  Dr. Y from Plastic Surgery and Lymphedema Management Clinic is following.\n\nI appreciate the opportunity of participating in this patient's care.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at any time.  I will continue to follow the patient along with you 2-3 times per week during this hospitalization at the Long-Term Acute Care Facility.

She was intubated and fishbone.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes, hypertension, asthma, cholecystectomy, and total hysterectomy and cataract.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Prevacid, Humulin, Diprivan, Proventil, Unasyn, and Solu-Medrol.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Negative for illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Please see the hospital chart.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Please see the hospital chart.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the operating room by Dr. X who is covering for ENT and noted that she had airway compromise and a rather large fishbone noted and that was removed.  The patient was intubated and it was felt that she should be observed to see if the airway would improve upon which she could be extubated.  If not she would require tracheostomy.  The patient was treated with IV antibiotics and ventilatory support and at the time of this dictation, she has recently been taken to the operating room where it was felt that the airway sufficient and she was extubated.  She was doing well with good p.o.s, good airway, good voice, and desiring to be discharged home.  So, the patient is being prepared for discharge at this point.  We will have Dr. X evaluate her before she leaves to make sure I do not have any problem with her going home.  Dr. Y feels she could be discharged today and will have her return to see him in a week.

She had a nerve conduction study and a diagnosis of radiculopathy was made.  She had an MRI of lumbosacral spine, which was within normal limits.  She then developed a tingling sensation in the right middle toe. \n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nREASON FOR NEUROLOGICAL CONSULTATION:  Cervical spondylosis and kyphotic deformity.  The patient was seen in conjunction with medical resident Dr. X. I personally obtained the history, performed examination, and generated the impression and plan.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 45-year-old African-American female whose symptoms first started some one and a half years ago with pain in the left shoulder and some neck pain.  This has subsequently resolved.  She started vigorous workouts in November 2005.  In March of this year, she suddenly could not feel her right foot on the bathroom floor and subsequently went to her primary care physician.  By her report, she had a nerve conduction study and a diagnosis of radiculopathy was made.  She had an MRI of lumbosacral spine, which was within normal limits.  She then developed a tingling sensation in the right middle toe.  Symptoms progressed to sensory symptoms of her knees, elbows, and left middle toe.  She then started getting sensory sensations in the left hand and arm.  She states that she feels a little bit wobbly at the knees and that she is slightly dragging her left leg.  Symptoms have been mildly progressive.  She is unaware of any trigger other than the vigorous workouts as mentioned above.  She has no associated bowel or bladder symptoms.  No particular position relieves her symptoms.\n\nWorkup has included two MRIs of the C-spine, which were personally reviewed and are discussed below.  She saw you for consultation and the possibility of surgical decompression was raised.  At this time, she is somewhat reluctant to go through any surgical procedure.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1.  Ocular migraines.\n2.  Myomectomy.\n3.  Infertility.\n4.  Hyperglycemia.\n5.  Asthma.\n6.  Hypercholesterolemia.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Lipitor, Pulmicort, Allegra, Xopenex, Patanol, Duac topical gel, Loprox cream, and Rhinocort.\n\nALLERGIES:  Penicillin and aspirin.\n\nFamily history, social history, and review of systems are discussed above as well as documented in the new patient information sheet.  Of note, she does not drink or smoke.  She is married with two adopted children.  She is a paralegal specialist.  She used to exercise vigorously, but of late has been advised to stop exercising and is currently only walking.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She does complain of mild blurred vision, but these have occurred before and seem associated with headaches.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, blood pressure 138/82, pulse 90, respiratory rate 14, and weight 176.5 pounds.  Pain scale is 0.  A full general and neurological examination was personally performed and is documented on the chart.  Of note, she has a normal general examination.  Neurological examination reveals normal cognition and cranial nerve examination including normal jaw jerk.  She has mild postural tremor in both arms.  She has mild decreased sensation in the right palm and mild decreased light touch in the right palm and decreased vibration sense in both distal lower extremities.  Motor examination reveals no weakness to individual muscle testing, but on gait she does have a very subtle left hemiparesis.  She has hyperreflexia in her lower extremities, worse on the left.  Babinski's are downgoing.\n\nPERTINENT DATA:  MRI of the brain from 05/02/06 and MRI of the C-spine from 05/02/06 and 07/25/06 were personally reviewed.  MRI of the brain is broadly within normal limits.  MRI of the C-spine reveals large central disc herniation at C6-C7 with evidence of mild cord compression and abnormal signal in the cord suggesting cord edema.  There is also a fairly large disc at C3-C4 with cord deformity and partial effacement of the subarachnoid space.  I do not appreciate any cord edema at this level.\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  The patient is a 45-year-old female with cervical spondylosis with a large C6-C7 herniated disc with mild cord compression and signal change at that level.  She has a small disc at C3-C4 with less severe and only subtle cord compression.  History and examination are consistent with signs of a myelopathy.\n\nResults were discussed with the patient and her mother.  I am concerned about progressive symptoms.  Although she only has subtle symptoms now, we made her aware that with progression of this process, she may have paralysis.  If she is involved in any type of trauma to the neck such as motor vehicle accident, she could have an acute paralysis.  I strongly recommended to her and her mother that she followup with you as soon as possible for surgical evaluation.  I agree with the previous physicians who have told her not to exercise as I am sure that her vigorous workouts and weight training since November 2005 have contributed to this problem.  I have recommended that she wear a hard collar while driving.  The results of my consultation were discussed with you telephonically.

I do not have the records from this hospital admission, but apparently the epidural was administered for approximately 14 to 18 hours.  She was sitting up during the epidural.\n\nShe did not notice any difference in her lower extremities at the time she had the epidural; however, she reports that she was extremely sleepy and may not have been aware of any change in strength or sensation in her lower extremities at that time.  She delivered on the 31st of October, by Cesarean section, because she had failed to progress and had pyrexia.\n\nShe also had a Foley catheter placed at that time.  On the 1st of November 2008, they began to mobilize her and it was at that time that she first noticed that she could not walk.  She was aware that she could not move her legs at all, and then within a few days, she was aware that she could move toes in the left foot but could not move her right foot at all.  Since that time, there has been a gradual improvement in strength to the point that she now has limited movement in her left leg and severely restricted movement in her right leg.  She is not able to walk by herself, and needs assistance to stand.  She was discharged from hospital after the Cesarean section on the 3rd of November.  Unfortunately, we do not have the records and we do not know what the discussion was between the anesthesiologist and the patient at the time of discharge.  She was then seen at ABC Hospital on November 05, 2008.  She had an MRI scan of her spine, which showed no evidence of an abnormality, specifically there were no cord changes and no evidence of a hematoma.  She also had an EMG study at that time by Dr. X, which was abnormal but not diagnostic and this was repeated again in December.  At the present time, she also complains of a pressure in both her legs and in her thighs.  She complains that her right foot hurts and that she has some hyperesthesia there.  She has been taking gabapentin to try to reduce the discomfort, although she is on a very low dose and the effect is minimal.  She has no symptoms in her arms, her bowel and bladder function is normal, and her bulbar function is normal.  There is no problem with her vision, swallowing, or respiratory function.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Unremarkable except as noted above.  She has seasonal allergies.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Gabapentin 300 mg b.i.d., Centrum once a day, and another multivitamin.\n\nALLERGIES:  She has no medication allergies, but does have seasonal allergies.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  There is a family history of diabetes and hypertension.  There is no family history of a neuropathy or other neurological disease.  She has one child, a son, born on October 31, 2008.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a civil engineer, who currently works from home.  She is working approximately half time because of limitations imposed on her by her disability, need to attend frequent physical therapy, and also the needs of looking after her baby.  She does not smoke and does not drink and has never done either.\n\nGENERAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nVITAL SIGNS:  P 74, BP 144/75, and a pain score of 0.\nGENERAL:  Her general physical examination was unremarkable.\nCARDIOVASCULAR:  Normal first and second heart sound, regular pulse with normal volume.\nRESPIRATORY:  Unremarkable, both lung bases were clear, and respiration was normal.\nGI:  Unremarkable, with no organomegaly and normal bowel sounds.\n\nNEUROLOGICAL EXAM:\nMSE:  The patient's orientation was normal, fund of knowledge was normal, memory was normal, speech was normal, calculation was normal, and immediate and long-term recall was normal.  Executive function was normal.\nCRANIAL NERVES:  The cranial nerve examination II through XII was unremarkable.  Both disks were normal, with normal retina.  Pupils were equal and reactive to light.  Eye movements were full.  Facial sensation and strength was normal.  Bulbar function was normal.  The trapezius had normal strength.\nMOTOR:  Muscle tone showed a slight increase in tone in the lower extremities, with normal tone in the upper extremities.  Muscle strength was 5/5 in all muscle groups in the upper extremities.  In the lower extremities, the hip flexors were 1/5 bilaterally, hip extensors were 1/5 bilaterally, knee extension on the right was 1/5 and on the left was 3-/5, knee flexion was 2/5 on the right and 3-/5 on the left, foot dorsiflexion was 0/5 on the right and 1/5 on the left, foot plantar flexion was 4-/5 on the right and 4+/5 on the left, toe extension was 0/5 on the right and 4-/5 on the left, toe flexion was 4-/5 on the right and 4+/5 on the left.\nREFLEXES:  Reflexes in the upper extremities were 2+ bilaterally.  In the lower extremities, they were 0 bilaterally at the knee and ankles.  The abdominal reflexes were present above the umbilicus and absent below the umbilicus.  The plantar responses were mute.  The jaw reflex was normal.\nSENSATION:  Vibration was moderately decreased in the right great toe and was mildly decreased in the left great toe.  There was a sensory level to light touch at approximately T7 posteriorly and approximately T9 anteriorly.  There was a range of sensation, but clearly there was a decrease in sensation below this level but not complete loss of sensation.  To pain, the sensory level is even less clear, but appeared to be at about T7 on the right side.  In the lower extremities, there was a slight decrease in pin and light touch in the right great toe compared to the left.  There was no evidence of allodynia or hyperesthesia.  Joint position sense was mildly reduced in the right toe and normal on the left.\nCOORDINATION:  Coordination for rapid alternating movements and finger-to-nose testing was normal.  Coordination could not be tested in the lower extremities.\nGAIT:  The patient was unable to stand and therefore we were unable to admin gait or Romberg's.  There was no evidence of focal back tenderness.\n\nREVIEW OF OUTSIDE RECORDS:  I have reviewed the records from ABC Hospital, including the letter from Dr. Y and the EMG report dated 12/17/2008 from Dr. X. The EMG report shows evidence of a lumbosacral polyradiculopathy below approximately T6.  The lower extremity sensory responses are essentially normal; however, there is a decrease in the amplitude of the motor responses with minimal changes in latency.  I do have the MRI of lumbar spine report from 11/06/2008 with and without contrast.  This showed a minimal concentric disc bulge of L4-L5 without disc herniation, but was otherwise unremarkable.  The patient brought a disc with a most recent MRI study; however, we were unable to open this on our computers.  The verbal report is that the study was unremarkable except for some gadolinium enhancement in the lumbar nerve roots.  A Doppler of the lower extremities showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity.  Chest x-ray showed some scoliosis on the lumbar spine, curve to the left, but no evidence of other abnormalities.  A CT pelvis study performed on November 07, 2008 showed some nonspecific fluid in the subcutaneous fat of the back, posterior to L4 and L5 levels; however, there were no pelvic masses or other abnormalities.  We were able to obtain an update of the report from the MRI of the lumbar spine with and without contrast dated 12/30/2008.  The complete study included the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine.  There was diffuse enhancement of the nerve roots of the cauda equina that had increased in enhancement since prior exam in November.  It was also reported that the patient was given intravenous methylprednisolone and this had had no effect on strength in her lower extremities.\n\nIMPRESSION:  The patient has a condition that is temporarily related to the epidural injection she was given at the end of October 2008, prior to her Cesarean section.  It appears she became aware of weakness within two days of the administration of the epidural, she was very tired during the epidural and may have missed some change in her neurological function.  She was severely weak in both lower extremities, slightly worse on the right than the left.  There has been some interval improvement in her strength since the beginning of November 2008.  Her EMG study from the end of December is most consistent with a lumbosacral polyradiculopathy.  The MRI findings of gadolinium enhancement in the lumbar nerve roots would be most consistent with an inflammatory radiculitis most likely related to the epidural anesthesia or administration of the epidural.  There had been no response to IV methylprednisolone given to her at ABC.  The issue of having a lumbar puncture to look for evidence of inflammatory cells or an elevated protein had been discussed with her at both ABC and by myself.  The patient did not wish to consider a lumbar puncture because of concerns that this might worsen her condition.  At the present time, she is able to stand with aid but is unable to walk.  There is no evidence on her previous EMG of a demyelinating neuropathy.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1.  The diagnostic issues were discussed with the patient at length.  She is informed that this is still early in the course of the problem and that we expect her to show some improvement in her function over the next one to two years, although it is unclear as to how much function she will regain.\n2.  She is strongly recommended to continue with vigorous physical therapy, and to continue with the plan to mobilize her as much as possible, with the goal of trying to get her ambulatory.  If she is able to walk, she will need bilateral AFOs for her ankles, to improve her overall mobility.  I am not prescribing these because at the present time she does not need them.\n3.  We discussed increasing the dose of gabapentin.  The paresthesias that she has may indicate that she is actually regaining some sensory function, although there is a concern that as recovery continues, she may be left with significant neuropathic pain.  If this is the case, I have advised her to increase her gabapentin dose from 300 mg b.i.d. gradually up to 300 mg four times a day and then to 600 mg to 900 mg four times a day.  She may need other neuropathic pain medications as needed.  She will determine whether her current symptoms are significant enough to require this increase in dosage.\n4.  The patient will follow up with Dr. Y and his team at ABC Hospital.  She will also continue with physical therapy within the ABC system.

At that time, he reports both legs gave away on him and he fell.  He reported that he had some lightheadedness just before he fell and was slightly confused, but was aware of what was happening around him.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 79-year-old right-handed man who reports that approximately one and a half years ago, he fell down while walking in the living room from the bedroom.  At that time, he reports both legs gave away on him and he fell.  He reported that he had some lightheadedness just before he fell and was slightly confused, but was aware of what was happening around him.  He was able to get up shortly after falling and according to the patient and his son, subsequently returned back to normal.\n\nHe was then well until the 3rd of July 2008 when his legs again gave way on him.  This was not preceded by lightheadedness.  He was rushed to the hospital and was found to have pneumonia, and the fall was blamed on the pneumonia.  He started using a walker from that time, prior to that he was able to walk approximately two miles per day.  He again had a fall in August of 2008 after his legs gave way.  Again, there was no lightheadedness associated with this.  He was again found to have pneumonia and again was admitted to hospital after which he went to rehabilitation and was able to use his walker again after this.  He did not, however, return to the pre-July baseline.  In October of 2008, after another fall, he was found to have pneumonia again and shingles.  He is currently in a Chronic Rehabilitation Unit.  He cannot use a walker and uses a wheelchair for everything.  He states that his hands have been numb, involving all the fingers of both hands for the past three weeks.  He is also losing muscle bulk in his hands and has noticed some general weakness of his hands.  He does, however, note that strength in his hands has not been normal since July 2008, but it is clearly getting worse.  He has been aware of some fasciculations in his legs starting in August 2008, these are present both in the lower legs and the thighs.  He does not report any cramps, problems with swallowing or problems with breathing.  He reports that he has had constipation alternating with diarrhea, although there has been no loss of control of either his bowel or bladder.  He has had some problems with blood pressure drops, and does feel presyncopal when he stands.  He also reports that he has no feeling in his feet, and that his feet feel like sponges.  This has been present for about nine months.  He has also lost joint position sense in his feet for approximately nine months.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1.  Pneumonia.  He has had recurrent episodes of pneumonia, which started at approximately age 20.  These have been treated repeatedly over the years, and on average he has tended to have an episode of pneumonia once every five years, although this has been far more frequent in the past year.  He is usually treated with antibiotics and then discharged.  There is no known history of bronchiectasis, inherited lung disease or another chronic pulmonary cause for the repeated pneumonia.\n2.  He has had a catheter placed for urinary retention, his urologist has told him that he thinks that this may be due to prostate enlargement.  The patient does not have any history of diabetes and does not report any other medical problems.  He has lost approximately 18 pounds in the past month.\n3.  He had an appendectomy in the 1940s.\n4.  He had an ankle resection in 1975.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient stopped smoking 27 years ago, he smoked approximately two packs a day with combined cigarettes and cigars.  He has not smoked for the past 27 years.  He hardly ever uses alcohol.  He is currently retired.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  There is no family history of neuropathy, pes cavus, foot deformities, or neuromuscular diseases.  His aunt has a history of type II diabetes.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Fludrocortisone 0.1 mg p.o. q.d., midodrine 5 mg p.o. q.i.d., Cymbalta 30 mg p.o. per day, Prilosec 20 mg p.o. per day, Lortab 10 mg p.o. per day, Amoxil 500 mg p.o. per day, vitamin B12 1000 mcg weekly, vitamin D 1000 units per day, Metamucil p.r.n., enteric-coated aspirin once a day, Colace 200 mg p.o. q.d., Senokot three tablets p.o. p.r.n., Reglan 10 mg p.o. q.6h., Xanax 0.25 mg p.o. q.8h. p.r.n., Ambien 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. and Dilaudid 2 mg tablets p.o. q.3h. p.r.n., Protonix 40 mg per day, and Megace 400 mg per day.\n\nALLERGIES:  He has no medication or food allergies.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Please see the health questionnaire and clinical notes from today.\n\nGENERAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nVITAL SIGNS:  BP was 137/60, P was 89, and his weight could not be measured because he was in a wheelchair.  His pain score was 0.\nAPPEARANCE:  No acute distress.  He is pleasant and well-groomed.\nHEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic.  No carotid bruits appreciated.\nLUNGS:  There were few coarse crackles in both lung bases.\nCARDIOVASCULAR:  Revealed a normal first and second heart sound, with no third or fourth heart sound and no murmurs.  The pulse was regular and of normal volume.\nABDOMEN:  Soft with no masses and normal bowel sounds.  There were no carotid bruits.\nEXTREMITIES:  No contractures appreciated.\n\nNEUROLOGICAL EXAM:\nMSE:  His orientation, language, calculations, 100-7 tests were all normal.  There was atrophy and fasciculations in both the arms and legs.\nCRANIAL NERVES:  Cranial nerve examination was normal with the exception that there was some mild atrophy of his tongue and possible fasciculations.  His palatal movement was normal and gag reflex was normal.\nMOTOR:  Strength was decreased in all muscle groups as follows:  Deltoid 4/4, biceps 4+/4+, triceps 5/5, wrist extensors 4+/4+, finger extensors 4-/4-, finger flexors 4-/4-, interossei 4-/4-, hip flexors 4+/4+, hip extensors 4+/4+, knee extensors 4/4, and knee flexors 4/4.  Foot dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, eversion, toe extension and toe flexion was all 0 to 1.  There was atrophy in both hands and general atrophy of the lower limb muscles.  The feet were both cold and showed dystrophic features.  Fasciculations were present mainly in the hands.  There was evidence of dysmetria and past pointing in the left hand.\nREFLEXES:  Reflexes were 0 in all sites in the arms and legs.  The jaw reflex was 2+.  Vibration was severely decreased at the elbow and wrist and was absent in the fingers.  Vibration was absent in the toes and ankle bilaterally and was severely decreased at the knee.  Joint position sense was absent in the toes and severely decreased in the fingers.  Pin perception was absent in the feet and was decreased to the upper thighs.  Pin was decreased or absent in the fingers and decreased above the elbows.  The same distribution of sensory loss was found with monofilament testing.\nCOORDINATION:  Coordination was barely normal in the right hand.  Rapid alternating movements were decreased in the left hand greater than the right hand.  The patient was unable to stand and therefore gait, Romberg's admin and balance could not be assessed.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:  Previous diagnostic studies and patient reports.  There were extensive patient reports, all of which were reviewed.  A previous x-ray study of the lateral chest performed in October 2008 showed poor inspiration with basilar atelectasis and an infiltrate.  An x-ray of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine showed some evidence of lumbar spinal stenosis.  A CTA of the neck with and without contrast performed in November 2008 showed minor stenosis in the left carotid, a mild hard and soft plaque in the right carotid with approximately 55% stenosis.  The posterior circulation showed a slightly dominant right vertebral artery with no stenosis.  There was no significant stenosis, but there was minor extracranial stenosis noted.  An MRI of the brain with and without contrast performed in November 2008 showed no evidence of an acute infarct, major vascular occlusion, and no abnormal enhancement with gadolinium administration.  There was also no significant sinusitis or mastoiditis.  This was an essentially normal brain MRI.  A CBC performed in January 2009 showed an elevated white cell count of 11.3, a low red cell count of 3.43, elevated MCH of 32.4 and the rest of the study was normal.  An electrolyte study performed in January 2009 showed a sodium which was low at 127, a calcium which was low at 8.3, and a low protein of 5.2 and albumin of 3.1.  The glucose was 86.  TSH performed in January 2009 was 1.57, which is within the normal range.  Vitamin B12 was greater than a 1000, which is normal and the folate was 18.2, which was normal.  A myocardial stress study performed in December 2008 showed normal myocardial perfusion with Persantine Cardiolite SPECT.  The ECG was non-diagnostic.  There was normal regional wall motion of the left ventricle.  The left ventricular ejection fraction was 68%, which is within the normal range for males.  A CT of the lumbar spine without contrast performed in December 2008 showed a broad-based disc bulge at L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4 and L4-L5.  At L5-S1, in addition to the broad-based disc bulge, there was also an osteophyte complex and evidence of flavum hypertrophy without canal stenosis.  There was severe bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 and moderate neural foraminal stenosis at L1-L4.  An echocardiogram was performed in November 2008 and showed mild left atrial enlargement, normal left ventricular systolic function, mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, scleral degenerative changes in the aortic and mitral apparatus, mild mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation and mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  The patient presents with a severe neuropathy with marked large fiber sensory as well as motor findings.  He is diffusely weak as well as atrophic in all muscle groups both in his upper and lower extremities, although he is disproportionately weak in his lower extremities.  His proprioceptive and vibratory loss is severe in both the distal upper and lower extremities, signifying that he either has a severe sensory neuropathy or has involvement of the dorsal root ganglia.  According to the history, which was carefully checked, the initial onset of these symptoms goes back one and a half years, although there has only been significant progression in his condition since July 2008.  As indicated below, further diagnostic studies including a detailed nerve conduction and EMG admin today showed evidence of a severe sensory, motor, and axonal neuropathy and in addition there was evidence of a diffuse polyradiculopathy.  There was no involvement of the tongue on EMG.  The laboratory testing as indicated below failed to show a specific cause for the neuropathy.  We are still, however, waiting for the paraneoplastic antibodies, which were send out lab to the Mayo Clinic.  This type of very severe sensorimotor neuropathy with significant proprioceptive loss may be seen in several conditions including peripheral nerve vasculitis due to a variety of disorders such as SLE, Sjogren's, rheumatoid arthritis, and mixed connective tissue disease.  In addition, it may also be seen with certain toxins, particularly chemotherapeutic agents.  The patient did not receive any of these.  It may also be seen as part of a paraneoplastic syndrome.  Although the patient does not have any specific clinical symptoms of a cancer, it is noted that he has had an 18-pound weight loss in the past month and does have a remote history of smoking.  We have requested that he obtain a CT of his chest, abdomen and pelvis while he is in Acute Rehabilitation.  The verbal reports of these possibly did not show any evidence of a cancer.  We did also request that he obtain a gallium scan to see if there was any evidence of an unsuspected neoplasm.  The patient did undergo a nerve and muscle biopsy, this was a radial nerve and biceps muscle biopsy from the left arm.  This showed evidence of severe axonal loss.  There was no evidence of a vasculitis.  The vessels did show some mild intimal changes that would be consistent with atherosclerosis.  There were a few perivascular changes; however, there was no clear evidence of a necrotizing vasculitis even on multiple sections.  The muscle biopsy showed severe muscle fiber atrophy, with evidence of fiber grouping.  Again, there was no evidence of inflammation or vasculitis.  Evaluation so far has also shown no evidence of an amyloid neuropathy, no evidence of a monoclonal gammopathy, of sarcoidosis, and again there is no past history of a significant toxin or infective cause for the neuropathy.  Specifically, there is no history of HIV exposure.  We would await the results of the gallium scan and of the paraneoplastic antibodies to see if these are helpful in making a diagnosis.  At this point, because of the severity and the axonal nature of the neuropathy, there is no specific therapy that will reverse the course of the illness, unless we find a specific etiology that can be stopped or reversed.  I have discussed these issues at length with the patient and with his son.  We also addressed whether or not there might be a previously undiagnosed inherited neuropathy.  I think this is unlikely given the short history and the rapid progression of the disorder.\n\nThere is also no family history that we can detect a neuropathy, and the patient does not have the typical phenotype for a chronic inherited neuropathy such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2.  However, since I have only seen the patient on one occasion and do not know what his previous examination showed two years ago, I cannot be certain that there may not have been the presence of a neuropathy preceding this.\n\nPLAN:\n1.  Nerve conduction and EMG will be performed today.  The results were indicated above.\n2.  The following laboratory studies were requested including electrolytes, CBC, thyroid function tests, B12, ANA, C-reactive protein, complement, cryoglobulins, double-stranded DNA antibodies, folate level, hemoglobin A1c, immunofixation electrophoresis, P-ANCA, C-ANCA, protein electrophoresis, rheumatoid factor, paraneoplastic antibody studies requested from the Mayo Clinic, B12.  These studies showed minor changes, which included a low sodium level of 129 as previously noted, a low creatinine of 0.74, low calcium of 8.6, low total protein of 5.7.  The B12 was greater than 2000.  The immunoelectrophoresis, ANA, double-stranded DNA, ANCA, hemoglobin A1c, folate, cryoglobulins, complement, C-reactive protein were all normal or negative.  The B12 level was greater than 2000.  Liver function tests were normal.  The glucose was 90.  ESR was 10.  Hemoglobin A1c was 5.5.\n3.  A left radial sensory and left biceps biopsy were requested and have been performed and interpreted as indicated above.\n4.  CT of chest, abdomen and pelvis.\n5.  Whole body gallium scan for evidence of an underlying neoplasm.\n6.  The patient will go to the Rehabilitation Facility for Acute Rehabilitation and Training.\n7.  We have not made any changes to his medication.  He does have some mild orthostatic changes; however, he is adequately controlled with midodrine at a dose of 2.5 mg three times a day as needed up to 5 mg four times a day.  Usually, he uses a lower dose of 2.5 three times a day to 5 mg three times a day.\n8.  Followup will be as determined by the family.

A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nREASON FOR REFERRAL:  The patient is a 58-year-old African-American right-handed female with 16 years of education who was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X. She is presenting for a second opinion following a recent neuropsychological evaluation that was ordered by her former place of employment that suggested that she was in the &quot;early stages of a likely dementia&quot; and was thereafter terminated from her position as a psychiatric nurse.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.  Note that this evaluation was undertaken as a clinical exam and intended for the purposes of aiding with treatment planning.  The patient was fully informed about the nature of this evaluation and intended use of the results.\n\nRELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM:  The patient reported that she had worked as a nurse supervisor for Hospital Center for four years.  She was dismissed from this position in September 2009, although she said that she is still under active status technically, but is not able to work.  She continues to receive some compensation through FMLA hours.  She said that she was told that she had three options, to resign, to apply for disability retirement, and she had 90 days to complete the process of disability retirement after which her employers would file for charges in order for her to be dismissed from State Services.  She said that these 90 days are up around the end of November.  She said the reason for her dismissal was performance complaints.  She said that they began &quot;as soon as she arrived and that these were initially related to problems with her taking too much sick time off secondary to diabetes and fibromyalgia management and at one point she needed to obtain a doctor's note for any days off.  She said that her paperwork was often late and that she received discipline for not disciplining her staff frequently enough for tardiness or missed workdays.  She described it as a very chaotic and hectic work environment in which she was often putting in extra time.  She said that since September 2008 she only took two sick days and was never late to work, but that she continued to receive a lot of negative feedback.\n\nIn July of this year, she reportedly received a letter from personnel indicating that she was being referred to a state medical doctor because she was unable to perform her job duties and due to excessive sick time.  Following a brief evaluation with this doctor whose records we do not have, she was sent to a neuropsychologist, Dr. Y, Ph.D.  He completed a Comprehensive Independent Medical Evaluation on 08/14/2009.  She said that on 08/27/2009, she returned to see the original doctor who told her that based on that evaluation she was not able to work anymore.  Please note that we do not have copies of any of her work-related correspondence.  The patient never received a copy of the neuropsychological evaluation because she was told that it was &quot;too derogatory.&quot;  A copy of that evaluation was provided directly to this examiner for the purpose of this evaluation.  To summarize, the results indicated &quot;diagnostically, The patient presents cognitive deficits involving visual working memory, executive functioning, and motor functioning along with low average intellectual functioning that is significantly below her memory functioning and below expectation based on her occupational and academic history.  This suggests that her intellectual functioning has declined.&quot;  It concluded that &quot;results overall suggest early stages of a likely dementia or possibly the effects of diabetes, although her deficits are greater than expected for diabetes-related executive functioning problems and peripheral neuropathy   The patient' deficits within the current admin battery suggest that she would not be able to safely and effectively perform the duties of a nurse supervisor without help handling documentary demands and some supervision of her visual processing.  The prognosis for improvement is not good, although she might try stimulant medication if compatible with her other.  Following her dismissal, The patient presented to her primary physician, Henry Fein, M.D., who referred her to Dr. X for a second opinion regarding her cognitive deficits.  His neurological examination on 09/23/2009 was unremarkable.  The patient scored 20/30 on the Mini-Mental Status Exam missing one out of three words on recall, but was able to do so with prompting.  A repeat neurocognitive testing was suggested in order to assess for subtle deficits in memory and concentration that were not appreciated on this gross cognitive measure.\n\nIMAGING STUDIES:  MRI of the brain on 09/14/2009 was unremarkable with no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality or abnormal enhancing lesions.  Note that the MRI was done with and without gadolinium contrast.\n\nCURRENT FUNCTIONING:  The patient reported that she had experienced some difficulty completing paperwork on time due primarily to the chaoticness of the work environment and the excessive amount of responsibility that was placed upon her.  When asked about changes in cognitive functioning, she denied noticing any decline in problem solving, language, or nonverbal skills.  She also denied any problems with attention and concentration or forgetfulness or memory problems.  She continues to independently perform all activities of daily living.  She is in charge of the household finances, has had no problems paying bills on time, has had no difficulties with driving or accidents, denied any missed appointments and said that no one has provided feedback to her that they have noticed any changes in her cognitive functioning.  She reported that if her children had noticed anything they definitely would have brought it to her attention.  She said that she does not currently have a lawyer and does not intend to return to her previous physician.  She said she has not yet proceeded with the application for disability retirement because she was told that her doctors would have to fill out that paperwork, but they have not claimed that she is disabled and so she is waiting for the doctors at her former workplace to initiate the application.  Other current symptoms include excessive fatigue.  She reported that she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991, but generally symptoms are under better control now, but she still has difficulty secondary to fibromyalgia.  She also reported having fallen approximately five times within the past year.  She said that this typically occurs when she is climbing up steps and is usually related to her right foot &quot;like dragging.&quot;  Dr. X's physical examination revealed no appreciable focal peripheral deficits on motor or sensory testing and notes that perhaps these falls are associated with some stiffness and pain of her right hip and knee, which are chronic symptoms from her fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis.  She said that she occasionally bumps into objects, but denied noticing it happening one on any particular part of her body.  Muscle pain secondary to fibromyalgia reportedly occurs in her neck and shoulders down both arms and in her left hip.\n\nOTHER MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient reported that her birth and development were normal.  She denied any significant medical conditions during childhood.  As mentioned, she now has a history of fibromyalgia.  She also experiences some restriction in the range of motion with her right arm.  MRI of the C-spine 04/02/2009 showed a hemangioma versus degenerative changes at C7 vertebral body and bulging annulus with small central disc protrusion at C6-C7.  MRI of the right shoulder on 06/04/2009 showed small partial tear of the distal infraspinatus tendon and prominent tendinopathy of the distal supraspinatus tendon.  As mentioned, she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991.  She thought that this may actually represent early symptoms of fibromyalgia and said that symptoms are currently under control.  She also has diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, tension headaches, GERD, carpal tunnel disease, cholecystectomy in 1976, and ectopic pregnancy in 1974.  Her previous neuropsychological evaluation referred to an outpatient left neck cystectomy in 2007.  She has some difficulty falling asleep, but currently typically obtains approximately seven to eight hours of sleep per night.  She did report some sleep disruption secondary to unusual dreams and thought that she talked to herself and could sometimes hear herself talking in her sleep.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  NovoLog, insulin pump, metformin, metoprolol, amlodipine, Topamax, Lortab, tramadol, amitriptyline, calcium plus vitamin D, fluoxetine, pantoprazole, Naprosyn, fluticasone propionate, and vitamin C.\n\nSUBSTANCE USE:  The patient reported that she rarely drinks alcohol and she denied smoking or using illicit drugs.  She drinks two to four cups of coffee per day.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was born and raised in North Carolina.  She was the sixth of nine siblings.  Her father was a chef.  He completed third grade and died at 60 due to complications of diabetes.  Her mother is 93 years old.  Her last job was as a janitor.  She completed fourth grade.  She reported that she has no cognitive problems at this time.  Family medical history is significant for diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, thyroid problems, sarcoidosis, and possible multiple sclerosis and depression.  The patient completed a Bachelor of Science in Nursing through State University in 1979.  She denied any history of problems in school such as learning disabilities, attentional problems, difficulty learning to read, failed grades, special help in school or behavioral problems.  She was married for two years.  Her ex-husband died in 1980 from acute pancreatitis secondary to alcohol abuse.  She has two children ages 43 and 30.  Her son whose age is 30 lives nearby and is in consistent contact with her and she is also in frequent contact and has a close relationship with her daughter who lives in New York.  In school, the patient reported obtaining primarily A's and B's.  She said that her strongest subject was math while her worst was spelling, although she reported that her grades were still quite good in spelling.  The patient worked for Hospital Center for four years.  Prior to that, she worked for an outpatient mental health center for 2-1/2 years.  She was reportedly either terminated or laid off and was unsure of the reason for that.  Prior to that, she worked for Walter P. Carter Center reportedly for 21 years.  She has also worked as an OB nurse in the past.  She reported that other than the two instances reported above, she had never been terminated or fired from a job.  In her spare time, the patient enjoys reading, participating in women's groups doing puzzles, playing computer games.\n\nPSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:  The patient reported that she sought psychotherapy on and off between 1991 and 1997 secondary to her chronic fatigue.  She was also taking Prozac during that time.  She then began taking Prozac again when she started working at secondary to stress with the work situation.  She reported a chronic history of mild sadness or depression, which was relatively stable.  When asked about her current psychological experience, she said that she was somewhat sad, but not dwelling on things.  She denied any history of suicidal ideation or homicidal ideation.\n\nTASKS ADMINISTERED:\nClinical Interview\nAdult History Questionnaire\nWechsler admin of Adult Reading (WTAR)\nMini Mental Status Exam (MMSE)\nCognistat Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination\nRepeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; Form XX)\nMattis Dementia Rating Scale, 2nd Edition (DRS-2)\nNeuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB)\nWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III)\nWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV)\nWechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI)\nTest of Variables of Attention (TOVA)\nAuditory Consonant Trigrams (ACT)\nPaced Auditory Serial Addition admin (PASAT)\nRuff 2 & 7 Selective Attention admin\nSymbol Digit Modalities admin (SDMT)\nMultilingual Aphasia Examination, Second Edition (MAE-II)\n Token admin\n Sentence Repetition\n Visual Naming\n Controlled Oral Word Association\n Spelling admin\n Aural Comprehension\n Reading Comprehension\nBoston Naming admin, Second Edition (BNT-2)\nAnimal Naming admin\nControlled Oral Word Association admin (COWAT:  F-A-S)\nThe Beery-Buktenica Developmental admin of Visual-Motor Integration (VMI)\nThe Beery-Buktenica Developmental admin of Motor Coordination\nThe Beery-Buktenica Developmental admin of Visual Perception\nHooper Visual Organization admin (VOT)\nJudgment of Line Orientation (JOLO)\nRey Complex Figure admin (RCFT)\nWechsler Memory Scale, Third Edition (WMS-III)\nWechsler Memory Scale, Fourth Edition (WMS-IV)\nCalifornia Verbal Learning admin, Second Edition (CVLT-II)\nRey Auditory-Verbal Learning admin (RAVLT)\nDelis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS)\n Trail Making admin\n Verbal Fluency (Letter & Category)\n Design Fluency\n Color-Word Interference admin\n Tower\nWisconsin Card Sorting admin (WCST)\nStroop Color-Word admin\nColor Trails\nTrail Making admin A & B\nWide Range Achievement admin, Fourth Edition (WRAT-IV)\nWoodcock Johnson Tests of Achievement, Third Edition (WJ-III)\nNelson-Denny Reading admin\nGrooved Pegboard\nPurdue Pegboard\nFinger Tapping admin\nBeck Depression Inventory (BDI)\nMood Assessment Scale (MAS)\nState-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)\nMinnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, Second Edition (MMPI-2)\nMillon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory, Third Edition (MCMI-III)\nMillon Behavioral Medicine Diagnostic (MBMD)\nBehavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF)\nAdaptive Behavior Assessment System, Second Edition (ABAS-II)\n\nBEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS:  The patient arrived unaccompanied and on time for her appointment.  She ambulated independently and no gross psychomotor abnormalities were noted.  Vision and hearing appeared to be adequate for testing.  She was neatly dressed and groomed.  Eye contact was good.  She was oriented to person, place, time, and situation.  Speech was mildly slow and a few mild articulatory errors were noted near the end of the day, and a few paraphasic errors were noted on a confrontation naming task.  There were otherwise no apparent problems with expression and speech was normal with respect to rhythm and prosody.  She was somewhat quiet, but quite cooperative throughout the day.  Affect appeared to be mildly constricted, but she smiled and joked appropriately at times.  Mood appeared to be euthymic.  Receptive language abilities appeared to be within broad normal limits as she was able to appropriately respond to the examiner's questions and instructions.  Thought processes were linear and goal-directed and no thought disturbances were noted.  She appeared quite tired near the end of the day and it should be noted that sustained attention task was the last admin that was given at the end of the day.  When asked, the patient said that she recognized some of the tests that were given, but not most of them.  She denied having look up any information on any of the tests that are typically involved in a neuropsychological battery or having any additional information about them since her last testing.  Overall, The patient appeared to put full effort into this evaluation.  She was highly motivated and thus these results should be seen as an accurate reflection of her current cognitive functioning.\n\nNote that there was some overlap in tests that were administered during this evaluation and those given at her evaluation in August of 2009.  These include the ways for CPT II, verbal fluency, and Boston Naming admin, but this exception of the ways for most of these tests are not expected to have a significant practice effect associated with them; however, they will be interpreted with her recent evaluation in mind.\n\nEVALUATION FINDINGS:\n\nClassification Level |--| Percentile Rank |--| Standard Score |--| Scaled Score |--| T-Score\nVery Superior |-----| &gt; 98 |-----| &gt;130 |-----| &gt; 16 |-----| &gt; 70\nSuperior  |-----| 91-97 |-----| 120-129 |-----| 14-15 |-----| 64-69\nHigh Average  |-----| 75-90 |-----| 110-119 |-----| 12-13 |-----| 57-63\nAverage  |-----| 25-74 |-----| 90-109 |-----| 8-11 |-----| 44-56\nLow Average  |-----| 9-24 |-----| 80-89 |-----| 6-7 |-----| 37-43\nBorderline  |-----| 2-8 |-----| 68-79 |-----| 4-5 |-----| 29-36\nImpaired  |-----| &lt; 1 |-----| &lt; 67  |-----| 1-3 |-----| &lt; 28\n\nGENERAL COGNITIVE ABILITY:  The patient performed in the high average range on a measure of gross cognitive functioning.  Her performances were within expected limits across subtests assessing attention, initiation, visuospatial construction, conceptualization, and memory.\n\nINTELLECTUAL FUNCTIONING:  Based on a word reading admin, premorbid intellectual functioning was estimated to fall in the average range.  Current intellectual functioning fell in the average range (Full Scale IQ equals 98, 45th percentile).  Her index scores also indicated average performance across tasks assessing the verbal knowledge and comprehension, visuospatial perception and reasoning, working memory (i.e. complex attention) and information processing.  Significant relative strengths were seen on tasks assessing stored verbal knowledge and nonverbal reasoning.  Significant relative weaknesses were seen on task assessing visuospatial perception and construction that included a time demand (low average).  Compared to her previous admin results, the pattern of findings is quite similar with stronger performance on verbal relative to nonverbal tasks or those with significant working memory or speed demands.  However, she performed somewhat better on most of these tasks in the current evaluation.  To some degree this likely reflects measurement error and variability in addition to some practice effects, although some tests are less susceptible to such changes relative to others.\n\nACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT:  The patient performed within the average range across tasks assessing word reading, sentence comprehension, and spelling skills.  Her previous evaluation referred to a number of misspellings that she had made on her list of medications and certain medical conditions and she made consistent errors again during this evaluation suggesting that she may simply have a weakness in this area.\n\nATTENTION:  Auditory working memory was within the average range.  Visual working memory was low average.  On a selective visual attention admin, she demonstrated good accuracy in finding target stimuli while scanning information, although her overall speed was in the low average range.  On a continuous performance admin assessing sustained attention, she also demonstrated good accuracy, although it was noted that her response time tended to be slower when stimuli were presented with a longer interstimulus interval suggesting some difficulty adapting to changes in the temporal stimulus presentation.  Note that this latter performance is entirely consistent with her previous results and taken together these results suggest that attentional abilities were generally within expectations with some mildly weaker performance for complex visual relative to verbal information.  There were inconsistencies noted in attentional abilities for both verbal and visual working memory.\n\nINFORMATION PROCESSING SPEED:  As noted, the patient had some difficulty adapting to changes in stimulus presentation speed on sustained attention task and there was some suggestion in her performances that she reduced her speed in order to increase accuracy; however, basic visual scanning and sequencing and psychomotor processing were in the average to high average range.\n\nLANGUAGE:  Mild articulatory and paraphasic errors were noted on a confrontation naming admin.  Verbal retrieval for phonemic or category cues were in the high average and average range respectively.  Stored verbal knowledge was in the average range with as mentioned strengths noted in vocabulary.  Those language abilities were generally within expected limits.\n\nVISUOSPATIAL PERCEPTION AND CONSTRUCTION:  The patient demonstrated variability in her performances on tasks assessing visuospatial perception and construction.  Basic visual perception assessed through her ability to accurately interpret angular line orientations was in the high average.  Mental organization and synthesis of parts of visual figures was in the average range on an untimed task that involved namable objects and in the low average range and relative weakness when it involved timed synthesis of shapes.\n\nVisuospatial construction using either line drawings or blocks to match to a sample design was in the borderline to low average range.  Thus taken together, the patient demonstrated some relative weaknesses in aspects of visuospatial processing, particularly when tasks involved the time component or shapes and figures rather than recognizable objects.\n\nLEARNING & MEMORY SKILLS:\n\n VERBAL LEARNING AND MEMORY:  Initial acquisition of a list of 15 unrelated items within the high average range (she successfully recalled eight items).  She benefited significantly from repetition and demonstrated immediate and significant improvement in her recall, although across five learning trials, her learning curve was mildly inconsistent suggesting attentional weaknesses; however, following the fifth trial, her overall learning fell in the superior range (all 15 items were successfully recalled).  Spontaneous recall following a 20-minute delay was in the average range as she was able to remember 11 of the 15 items.  She correctly recognized all those items during recognition (high average).  Taking together these memory results are well within expected limits.  She demonstrated some mild forgetting, but still fell within the average range and was able to recognize items effectively suggesting mild weaknesses and inconsistencies with retrieval and attentional weaknesses may have contributed to variability in her learning curve initially.\n\n VISUAL LEARNING AND MEMORY:  The patient' immediate recall of a complex figure was in the average range.  She retained all of that information following a delay and her recall was in the high average range.  Recognition of the individual components of the figure was impaired.  Taken together these results highlight some difficulties with complex visuospatial perception and construction, although memory per se was intact based on her very strong recall performances.  Note also that she demonstrated this strong memory despite some initial errors in her copy of the complex figure itself again highlighting difficulties with perception and construction, but good overall memory functioning.\n\nEXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING:  As mentioned, working memory was stronger for verbal than visual information, but both were within broad normal limits.  Verbal fluency was within expected limits as well and she demonstrated particular strength in switching between semantic categories (very superior).  Design fluency was average.  Cognitive set shifting, inhibition of prepotent responses and planning and problem solving all fell within the average to high average range and within expected limits.  Abstract reasoning for visual and verbal information was also good.  Thus taken together, the patient did not demonstrate any difficulties with tasks assessing executive functioning.\n\nMOTOR FUNCTIONING:  Fine motor coordination skills were within the average range with both her right dominant hand and left hand.  Strength was impaired on both sides while basic motor speed was in the borderline range for both hands.  These results are very similar to those that were found in her previous evaluation.  They are consistent with decreased strength, but no loss of dexterity and they do not suggest any lateralized deficits.\n\nEMOTIONAL FUNCTIONING:  On an affective screening measure, the patient endorsed only three items suggesting reduced energy and reduced clarity of thinking.  Overall, these results suggest that she is not experiencing clinically significant depressive symptoms at this time.\n\nSUMMARY & IMPRESSIONS:  This is a 58-year-old African-American female with 16 years of education who is referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X in order to assess for possible cognitive impairment.  She reported that she had recently been terminated from her position as a supervisory nurse in a psychiatric hospital following a neuropsychological evaluation that concluded that she may be in the &quot;early stages of a likely dementia&quot;.\n\nThis evaluation was requested as a second opinion in order to clarify the nature of her cognitive impairment and make recommendations for ongoing treatment planning.\n\nOverall, intellectual functioning fell in the average range on this evaluation.  Note that the same battery of tests was used in order to assess intellectual functioning and given the recency of her previous evaluation to some degree practice effects may have impacted her performance.  However, we would not expect as significant of an impact upon tasks assessing processing speed and working memory.  The same pattern of performance was noted across subtests in the intellectual battery with stronger performance on verbal knowledge based tasks relative to those assessing processing speed, working memory, and visuospatial skills.  However, during this evaluation, she demonstrated significant improvement across tasks so that in general her profile is elevated, but the same profile pattern was seen.  Note that along with practice effects, performance can also be impacted by changes in attention, as well as measurement error.  The possibility of attentional fluctuations having contributed to some of her performance is a definite possibility based on her performance on some attention tasks, which suggested that she at times performed better and was able to sequence in mind more information than she was able to passively repeat and she demonstrated inconsistencies in her learning curve on the memory task.  Our assessment of her intelligence as falling within the average range is consistent with our estimate of premorbid intellectual functioning and educational and occupational history.  Note that the ways for technical manual indicates that admin retest gains are less pronounced for verbal comprehension and working memory subtests than perceptual reasoning and processing speed subtests and The patient' improvements were much higher than the mean increases in the normative sample that averaged a shorter period between testing and retesting.  This suggests that as noted above other factors were applied, perhaps including attentional fluctuations.  Relative to intellectual functioning, the patient performed within expected limits across tasks assessing language functioning, verbal and visual memory, and executive skills and sustained attention.  Variability in performances was seen for information processing speed, particularly when responding to changes in the tempo of stimulus presentation or making more complex visual discriminations.  Immediate attention was also somewhat variable as she should be able to mentally manipulate greater amounts of visual and verbal material and she could just passively replicate.  The better performance on raw scores on these more complex tasks is unusual and suggests fluctuations in attention for reasons other than brain base deficits.  She also demonstrated weaker skills in complex visuospatial processing, particularly for shapes and figures rather than recognizable objects.  Of note, she performed poorly when these tasks involved the time component.  Meteorically, she demonstrated bilateral impairments in strength and motor speed, but dexterity and fine motor manipulation skills were within expected limits.  The lack of lateralizing information and motor skills suggests that more peripheral factors and pain may have contributed to these results.  Taken together, these results do not necessarily suggest that there has been any significant decline from premorbid levels.  It is possible that the patient has always had weaknesses in visuospatial processing and note that these weaknesses were not in basic visual skills and processing skills, but rather in putting together shapes and figures.  The inconsistencies in her performances on processing speed and attention tasks suggest that while she may be somewhat slowed in completing tasks, there may be contributors other than brain base changes that impacted her results.  In particular, the patient' current medications, as well as pain, fatigue, and medical conditions such as diabetes and associated possible neuropathy are likely important factors.\n\nResults do not suggest the presence of a progressive dementing disorder.  Given the multiple factors that may have contributed to some of our findings, we do not believe that any cognitive disorder should be diagnosed at this time.  If there are significant concerns about her cognitive functioning, it may be useful to make adjustments in her medication regimen.  This is a not a work based evaluation and therefore questions regarding her ability to perform job duties will not be addressed.  One concern that we would like to bring up is that if visuospatial problems are of newer onset, they may be contributing to her recent falls and thus should be monitored for changes and progression and she should return for reevaluation in one year's time in order to determine any changes in her cognitive functioning.  Additional recommendations are provided below.\n\nNote that there was a little overlap in tests given between the two testing sessions aside from the ways for CPT to word fluency.  Also note that she completed the brief self-report instrument and all of her results fell within normal limits.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1.  Based on fluctuations in processing speed and attention, it is possible that the patient' current medications may be impacting her cognitive functioning to some degree.  Decisions regarding any changes are deferred to her physicians, but it may be useful to streamline her current medications while also continuing to effectively address symptoms.\n2.  The patient should return for reevaluation in one year's time to monitor her cognitive functioning and evaluate for any improvements in performance following any medication changes.  Note also that stress related to her work situation and the nature of her previous neuropsychological evaluation may have also contributed to some of her difficulties on that testing.\n3.  The nature of her frequent falls is uncertain, but it is possible that weaknesses in visuospatial processing may be contributing and this should be further evaluated by her physicians.

Mild gait impairment and mild cognitive slowing.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nREASON FOR VISIT:  The patient is a 74-year-old woman who presents for neurological consultation referred by Dr. X.  She is accompanied to the appointment by her husband and together they give her history.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a lovely 74-year-old woman who presents with possible adult hydrocephalus.  Danish is her native language, but she has been in the United States for many many years and speaks fluent English, as does her husband.\n\nWith respect to her walking and balance, she states &quot;I think I walk funny.&quot;  Her husband has noticed over the last six months or so that she has broadened her base and become more stooped in her pasture.  Her balance has also gradually declined such that she frequently touches walls and furniture to stabilize herself.  She has difficulty stepping up on to things like a scale because of this imbalance.  She does not festinate.  Her husband has noticed some slowing of her speed.  She does not need to use an assistive device.  She has occasional difficulty getting in and out of a car.  Recently she has had more frequent falls.  In March of 2007, she fell when she was walking to the bedroom and broke her wrist.  Since that time, she has not had any emergency room trips, but she has had other falls.\n\nWith respect to her bowel and bladder, she has no issues and no trouble with frequency or urgency.\n\nThe patient does not have headaches.\n\nWith respect to thinking and memory, she states she is still able to pay the bills, but over the last few months she states, &quot;I do not feel as smart as I used to be.&quot;  She feels that her thinking has slowed down.  Her husband states that he has noticed, she will occasionally start a sentence and then not know what words to use as she is continuing.\n\nThe patient has not had trouble with syncope.  She has had past episodes of vertigo, but not recently.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension diagnosed in 2006, reflux in 2000, insomnia, but no snoring or apnea.  She has been on Ambien, which is no longer been helpful.  She has had arthritis since year 2000, thyroid abnormalities diagnosed in 1968, a hysterectomy in 1986, and a right wrist operation after her fall in 2007 with a titanium plate and eight screws.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Her father died with heart disease in his 60s and her mother died of colon cancer.  She has a sister who she believes is probably healthy.  She has had two sons one who died of a blood clot after having been a heavy smoker and another who is healthy.  She has two normal vaginal deliveries.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her husband.  She is a nonsmoker and no history of drug or alcohol abuse.  She does drink two to three drinks daily.  She completed 12th grade.\n\nALLERGIES:  Codeine and sulfa.\n\nShe has a Living Will and if unable to make decisions for herself, she would want her husband, Vilheim to make decisions for her.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Premarin 0.625 mg p.o. q.o.d., Aciphex 20 mg p.o. q. daily, Toprol 50 mg p.o. q. daily, Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q. daily, multivitamin, Caltrate plus D, B-complex vitamins, calcium and magnesium, and vitamin C daily.\n\nMAJOR FINDINGS:  On examination today, this is a pleasant and healthy appearing woman.\nVITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 154/72, heart rate 87, and weight 153 pounds.  Pain is 0/10.\nHEAD:  Head is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Head circumference is 54 cm, which is in the 10-25th percentile for a woman who is 5 foot and 6 inches tall.\nSPINE:  Spine is straight and nontender.  Spinous processes are easily palpable.  She has very mild kyphosis, but no scoliosis.\nSKIN:  There are no neurocutaneous stigmata.\nCARDIOVASCULAR EXAM:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No carotid bruits.  No edema.  No murmur.  Peripheral pulses are good.  Lungs are clear.\nMENTAL STATUS:  Assessed for recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, and fund of knowledge.  She scored 30/30 on the MMSE when attention was tested with either spelling or calculations.  She had no difficulty with visual structures.\nCRANIAL NERVES:  Pupils are equal.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Face is symmetric.  Tongue and palate are midline.  Jaw muscles strong.  Cough is normal.  SCM and shrug 5 and 5.  Visual fields intact.\nMOTOR EXAM:  Normal for bulk, strength, and tone.  There was no drift or tremor.\nSENSORY EXAM:  Intact for pinprick and proprioception.\nCOORDINATION:  Normal for finger-to-nose.\nREFLEXES:  Are 2+ throughout.\nGAIT:  Assessed using the Tinetti assessment tool.  She was fairly quick, but had some unsteadiness and a widened base.  She did not need an assistive device.  I gave her a score of 13/16 for balance and 9/12 for gait for a total score of 22/28.\n\nREVIEW OF X-RAYS:  MRI was reviewed from June 26, 2008.  It shows mild ventriculomegaly with a trace expansion into the temporal horns.  The frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro is 3.8 cm with a flat 3rd ventricular contour and a 3rd ventricular span of 11 mm.  The sylvian aqueduct is patent.  There is no pulsation artifact.  Her corpus callosum is bowed and effaced.  She has a couple of small T2 signal abnormalities, but no significant periventricular signal change.\n\nASSESSMENT:  The patient is a 74-year-old woman who presents with mild progressive gait impairment and possible slowing of her cognition in the setting of ventriculomegaly suggesting possible adult hydrocephalus.\n\nPROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:\n1.  Possible adult hydrocephalus (331.5).\n2.  Mild gait impairment (781.2).\n3.  Mild cognitive slowing (290.0).\n\nPLAN:  I had a long discussion with the patient her husband.\n\nI think it is possible that the patient is developing symptomatic adult hydrocephalus.  At this point, her symptoms are fairly mild.  I explained to them the two methods of testing with CSF drainage.  It is possible that a large volume lumbar puncture would reveal whether she is likely to respond to shunt and I described that admin.  About 30% of my patients with walking impairment in a setting of possible adult hydrocephalus can be diagnosed with a large volume lumbar puncture.  Alternatively, I could bring her into the hospital for four days of CSF drainage to determine whether she is likely to respond to shunt surgery.  This procedure carries a 2% to 3% risk of meningitis.  I also explained that it would be reasonable to start with an outpatient lumbar puncture and if that is not sufficient we could proceed with admission for the spinal catheter protocol.

I have spoken with XYZ Medical Center Dr. X who has accepted the patient for transfer.  He was advised that the patient will be coming in a private vehicle due to fact that he is completely stable and appears to be in no acute distress.  Dr. X was happy to accept the transfer and indicated that the patient should come to the emergency room area with the transport paperwork.  The plan was explained in detail to the patient who stated that he understood and would comply.  The appropriate paperwork was created and one copy was given to the patient.\n\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  At the time of discharge, he was stable, vital signs stable, in no acute distress.

The patient complained of globus sensation high in her throat particularly with solid foods and with pills.  She denied history of coughing and chocking with meals. \n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nHISTORY:  The patient is a 71-year-old female, who was referred for an outpatient modified barium swallow study to objectively evaluate her swallowing function and safety.  The patient complained of globus sensation high in her throat particularly with solid foods and with pills.  She denied history of coughing and chocking with meals.  The patient's complete medical history is unknown to me at this time.  The patient was cooperative and compliant throughout this evaluation.\n\nSTUDY:  Modified barium swallow study was performed in the Radiology Suite in cooperation with Dr. X. The patient was seated upright at a 90-degree angle in a video imaging chair.  To evaluate her swallowing function and safety, she was administered graduated amounts of food and liquid mixed with barium in the form of thin liquids (teaspoon x3. cup sip x4); thickened liquid (cup sip x3); puree consistency (teaspoon x3); and solid consistency (1/4 cracker x1).  The patient was given 2 additional cup sips of thin liquid following the puree and solid food presentation.\n\nORAL STAGE:  The patient had no difficulty with bolus control and transport.  No spillage out lips.  The patient appears to have pocketing __________ particularly with puree and solid food between her right faucial pillars.  The patient did state that she had her tonsil taken out as a child and appears to be a diverticulum located in this state.  Further evaluation by an ENT is highly recommended based on the residual and pooling that occurred during this evaluation.  We were not able to clear out the residual with alternating cup sips and thin liquid.\n\nPHARYNGEAL STAGE:  No aspiration or penetration occurred during this evaluation.  The patient's hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movements are within the functional limits.  Epiglottic inversion is within functional limits.  She had no residual or pooling in the pharynx after the swallow.\n\nCERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE:  The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  The patient had no aspiration or penetration occurred during this evaluation.  She does appear to have a diverticulum in the area between her right faucial pillars.  Additional evaluation is needed by an ENT physician.\n\nPLAN:  Based on this evaluation, the following is recommended:\n1.  The patient's diet should consist regular consistency food with thin liquids.  She needs to take small bites and small sips to help decrease her risk of aspiration and penetration as well as reflux.\n2.  The patient should be referred to an otolaryngologist for further evaluation of her oral cavity particularly the area between her faucial pillars.\n\nThe above recommendations and results of the evaluation were discussed with the patient as well as her daughter and both responded appropriately.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to be required the patient's medical care.  She is not in need of skilled speech therapy and is discharged from my services.

A modified barium swallow study was ordered to objectively evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety and to rule out aspiration.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nHISTORY:  The patient is a 76-year-old male, with previous history of dysphagia, status post stroke.  The patient stated that he was at Hospital, secondary to his stroke, where he had his initial modified barium swallow study.  The patient stated that the results of that modified revealed aspiration with thin liquids only.  He is currently eating and drinking without difficulty and he feels that he can return to a regular diet with thin liquids.  A modified barium swallow study was ordered to objectively evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety and to rule out aspiration.\n\nSTUDY:  Modified barium swallow study was performed in the radiology suite in cooperation with Dr. X. The patient was seated upright and in a video-imaging chair throughout this assessment.\n\nTo evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety, he was administered graduated amounts of liquid and food mixed with barium in the form of thin liquids (teaspoon x3, cup sip x3); nectar-thick liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x3); pureed consistency (teaspoon x3); solid consistency (1/4 cracker x1).\n\nFINDINGS\n\nORAL STAGE:  The patient had no spillage out lips.  Oral residual after swallow with increased viscosity requiring multiple swallows to clear oral cavity.\n\nThe patient has reduced lingual retraction contributing to vallecula pooling after the swallow.  Trace premature spillage was noted with thin liquids during this assessment.\n\nPHARYNGEAL STAGE:  Aspiration noted on cup sips of thin liquid.  Trace-to-mild penetration with teaspoon amounts of thin liquid during and after the swallow.  The penetration after the swallow occurred secondary to spillage on the piriform sinuses into the laryngeal vestibule.  The patient has incomplete laryngeal closure, which allowed the aspiration and penetration with thin liquids.  The patient had no aspiration or penetration occur with nectar-thick liquid, puree, and solid food.  The patient has a mildly reduced hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movement that leads to incomplete epiglottic inversion that contributes to vallecula pooling.  Mild-to-moderate pooling in the vallecula after the swallow with liquids and puree, this residual did decrease with the solid feed presentation.  The patient has mild residual of pooling in the piriform sinuses after a swallow that did clear with sequential swallows.\n\nCERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE:  The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  Mild aspiration with cup sips of thin liquid, penetration during and after the swallow with teaspoon amounts of thin liquid.  No aspiration or penetration occurred with thick liquid, pureed, or solid food during this assessment.\n\nPROGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  With a modified diet, the patient's potential for swallowing safety is good.\n\nPLAN:\nBased on this evaluation, the following is recommended:\n1.  The patient should be on a regular diet with nectar-thick liquids to help prevent aspiration and penetration.\n2.  The patient should have unthickened water in between meals to help decrease his risk of dehydration.\n3.  The patient should complete good oral care two times a day to decrease bacterial growth in mouth.\n4.  The patient should be seated at a 90-degree angle when eating and drinking, as well as take small bites and small sips to help decrease risk of aspiration and penetration and reflux.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to evaluate the patient.  I look forward to working with him in the outpatient setting to improve his swallowing function and safety.  Outpatient skilled speech therapy is recommended for a trial of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy for muscle re-education, as well as to train patient to use swallowing techniques and maneuvers that should improve his swallowing function and safety.

He is on B12, iron, folic acid, and Procrit.  There are no sign or symptom of blood loss and a recent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which was negative.  His creatinine was 1.  My impression at this time is that he probably has an underlying myelodysplastic syndrome or bone marrow failure.  His creatinine on this hospitalization was up slightly to 1.6 and this may contribute to his anemia.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:  At this time, my recommendation for the patient is that he undergoes further serologic evaluation with reticulocyte count, serum protein, and electrophoresis, LDH, B12, folate, erythropoietin level, and he should undergo a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.  I have discussed the procedure in detail which the patient.  I have discussed the risks, benefits, and successes of that treatment and usefulness of the bone marrow and predicting his cause of refractory anemia and further therapeutic interventions, which might be beneficial to him.  He is willing to proceed with the studies I have described to him.  We will order an ultrasound of his abdomen because of the possible fullness of the spleen, and I will probably see him in follow up after this hospitalization.\n\nAs always, we greatly appreciate being able to participate in the care of your patient.  We appreciate the consultation of the patient.

He also has anemia and leukocytosis, which may be related to his Crohn disease as well as his underlying pneumonia.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nDIAGNOSES:\n1.  Pneumonia.\n2.  Crohn disease.\n3.  Anasarca.\n4.  Anemia.\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  I have a lot of swelling in my legs.\n\nHISTORY:  The patient is a 41-year-old gentleman with a long history of Crohn disease.  He has been followed by Dr. ABC, his primary care doctor, but he states that he has had multiple gastroenterology doctors and has not seen one in the past year to 18 months.  He has been treated with multiple different medications for his Crohn disease and most recently has been taking pulses of steroids off and on when he felt like he was having symptoms consistent with crampy abdominal pain, increased diarrhea, and low-grade fevers.  This has helped in the past, but now he developed symptoms consistent with pneumonia and was admitted to the hospital.  He has been treated with IV antibiotics and is growing Streptococcus.  At this time, he seems relatively stable although slightly dyspneic.  Other symptoms include lower extremity edema, pain in his ankles and knees, and actually symptoms of edema in his entire body including his face and upper extremities.  At this time, he continues to have symptoms consistent with diarrhea and malabsorption.  He also has some episodes of nausea and vomiting at times.  He currently has a cough and symptoms of dyspnea.  Further review of systems was not otherwise contributory.\n\nMEDICATIONS:\n1.  Prednisone.\n2.  Effexor.\n3.  Folic acid.\n4.  Norco for pain.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As mentioned above, but he also has anxiety and depression.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:\n1.  Small bowel resections.\n2.  Appendectomy.\n3.  A vasectomy.\n\nALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  He does smoke two packs of cigarettes per day.  He has no alcohol or drug use.  He is a painter.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for his father who died of IPF and irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As mentioned in the history of present illness and further review of systems is not otherwise contributory.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nGENERAL:  He is a thin appearing man in very mild respiratory distress when his oxygen is off.\nVITAL SIGNS:  His respiratory rate is approximately 18 to 20, his blood pressure is 100/70, his pulse is 90 and regular, he is afebrile currently at 96, and weight is approximately 163 pounds.\nHEENT:  Sclerae anicteric.  Conjunctivae normal.  Nasal and oropharynx are clear.\nNECK:  Supple.  No jugular venous pressure distention is noted.  There is no adenopathy in the cervical, supraclavicular or axillary areas.\nCHEST:  Reveals some crackles in the right chest, in the base, and in the upper lung fields.  His left is relatively clear with decreased breath sounds.\nHEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.\nABDOMEN:  Slightly protuberant.  Bowel sounds are present.  He is slightly tender and it is diffuse.  There is no organomegaly and no ascites appreciable.\nEXTREMITIES:  There is a mild scrotal edema and in his lower extremities he has 2 to 3+ edema at pretibial and lateral feet.\nDERMATOLOGIC:  Shows thin skin.  No ecchymosis or petechiae.\n\nLABORATORY STUDIES:  Laboratory studies are pertinent for a total protein of 3 and albumin of 1.3.  There is no M-spike observed.  His B12 is 500 with a folic acid of 11.  His white count is 21 with a hemoglobin of 10, and a platelet count 204,000.\n\nIMPRESSION AT THIS TIME:\n1.  Pneumonia in the face of fairly severe Crohn disease with protein-losing enteropathy and severe malnutrition with anasarca.\n2.  He also has anemia and leukocytosis, which may be related to his Crohn disease as well as his underlying pneumonia.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  At this time, I believe evaluation of protein intake and dietary supplement will be most appropriate.  I believe that he needs a calorie count.  We will check on a sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, LDH, prealbumin, thyroid, and iron studies in the morning with his laboratory studies that are already ordered.  I have recommended strongly to him that when he is out of the hospital, he return to the care of his gastroenterologist.  I will help in anyway that I can to improve the patient's laboratory abnormalities.  However, his lower extremity edema is primarily due to his marked hypoalbuminemia and I do not believe that diuretics will help him at this time.  I have explained this in detail to the patient and his family.  Everybody expresses understanding and all questions were answered.  At this time, follow him up during his hospital stay and plan to see him in the office as well.

The patient did receive skilled speech therapy while in the acute rehab, which focused on higher level cognitive and linguistic skills such as attention, memory, mental flexibility, and improvement of her executive function.  \n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:  Status post brain tumor with removal.\n\nSUBJECTIVE:  The patient is a 64-year-old female with previous medical history of breast cancer that has metastasized to her lung, liver, spleen, and brain, status post radiation therapy.  The patient stated that on 10/24/08 she had a brain tumor removed with subsequent left-sided weakness.  The patient was readmitted to ABC Hospital on 12/05/08 and was found to have massive swelling in the brain and a second surgery was performed to reduce the swelling.  The patient remained at the acute rehab at ABC until she was discharged home on 01/05/09.  The patient did receive skilled speech therapy while in the acute rehab, which focused on higher level cognitive and linguistic skills such as attention, memory, mental flexibility, and improvement of her executive function.  The patient also complains of difficulty with word retrieval and slurring of speech.  The patient denies any difficulty with swallowing at this time.\n\nOBJECTIVE:  Portions of the cognitive linguistic quick admin was administered.  An oral mechanism exam was performed.  A motor speech protocol was completed.\n\nThe cognitive linguistic subtests of recalling personal facts, symbol cancellation, confrontational naming, clock drawing, story retelling, generative naming, design and memory, and completion of mazes was administered.\n\nThe patient was 100% accurate with recalling personal facts, completion of the symbol cancellation tasks, and with confrontational naming.  She had no difficulty with the clock drawing task; however, she has considerable hand tremors, which makes writing difficult.  In the storytelling task, she scored within normal limits.  She was also within normal limits for generative naming.  She did have difficulty with the design, memory, and mazes subtests.  She was unable to complete the second maze during the allotted time.  The design generation subtest was also completed.  She was able to draw four unique designs, and toward the end of the tasks was no longer able to recall the stated direction.\n\nORAL MECHANISM EXAMINATION:  The patient has mild left facial droop with decreased nasolabial fold.  Tongue is at midline, and lingual range of motion and strength are within functional limit.  The patient does complain of biting her tongue on occasion, but denied biting the inside of her cheeks.  Her AMRs are judged to be within functional limit.  Her rate of speech is decreased with a monotonous vocal quality.  The decreased rate may be a compensation for decreased word retrieval ability.  The patient's speech is judged to be 100% intelligible without background noise.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  The patient has mild cognitive linguistic deficits in the areas of higher level cognitive function seen in mental flexibility, memory, and executive function.\n\nPLAN OF CARE:  Outpatient skilled speech therapy two times a week for four weeks to include cognitive linguistic treatment.\n\nSHORT-TERM GOALS (THREE WEEKS):\n1.  The patient will complete deductive reasoning and mental flexibility tasks with greater than 90% accuracy, independently.\n2.  The patient will complete perspective memory admin with 100% accuracy using compensatory strategy.\n3.  The patient will complete visual perceptual activities, which focus on scanning, flexibility, and problem solving with greater than 90% accuracy with minimal cueing.\n4.  The patient will listen to and/or read a lengthy narrative and be able to recall at least 6 details after a 15-minute delay, independently.\n\nPATIENT'S GOAL:  To improve functional independence and cognitive abilities.\n\nLONG-TERM GOAL (FOUR WEEKS):  Functional cognitive linguistic abilities to improve safety and independence at home and to decrease burden of care on caregiver.

She comes in today in consultation from ABC, nurse practitioner.  She comes in because of irregular periods and cyst on her ovaries.  She comes in with her mother from whom most of the history is taken.\n\nShe started her periods at age 13.  She is complaining of a three-month history of lower abdominal pain for which she has been to the emergency room twice.  She describes the pain as bilateral, intermittent, and non-radiating.  It decreases slightly when she eats and increases with activity.  She states the pain when it comes can last for half-a-day.  It is not associated with movement, but occasionally the pain was so bad that it was associated with vomiting.  She has tried LactAid, which initially helped, but then the pain returned.  She has tried changing her diet and Pepcid AC.  She was seen at XYZ where blood work was done.  At that time, she had a normal white count and a normal H&H.  She was given muscle relaxants, which did not work.\n\nApproximately two weeks ago, she was seen in the emergency room at XYZ where a pelvic ultrasound was done.  This showed a 1.9 x 1.4-cm cyst on the right with no free fluid.  The left ovary and uterus appeared normal.  Two days later, the pain resolved and she has not had a recurrence.  She denies constipation and diarrhea.  She has had some hot flashes, but has not taken her temperature.\n\nIn addition, she states that her periods have been very irregular coming between four and six weeks.  They are associated with cramping which she is not happy about.\n\nShe has never had a pelvic exam.  She states she is not sexually active and declined having her mother leave the room, so she was not questioned regarding this without her mother present.  She is very interested in not having pain with her periods and if this was a cyst that caused her pain, she is interested in starting birth control pills to prevent this from happening again.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HX:  Pneumonia in 2002, depression diagnosed in 2005, and seizures as an infant.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HX:  Plastic surgery on her ear after a dog bite in 1997.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Zoloft 50 mg a day and LactAid.\n\nALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.\n\nSOCIAL HX:  She enjoys cooking and scrapbooking.  She does have a boyfriend; again she states she is not sexually active.  She also states that she exercises regularly, does not smoke cigarettes, use drugs, or drink alcohol.\n\nFAMILY HX:  Significant for her maternal grandfather with adult-onset diabetes, a maternal grandmother with hypertension, mother with depression, and a father who died of colon cancer at 32 years of age.  She also has a paternal great grandfather who was diagnosed with colon cancer.\n\nPE:  VITALS: Height: 5 feet 5 inches.  Weight: 190 lb.  Blood Pressure: 120/88.  GENERAL: She is well-developed, well-nourished with normal habitus and no deformities.  NECK: Without thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy.  LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  HEART: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.  ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, and nondistended.  There is no organomegaly or lymphadenopathy.  PELVIC: Deferred.\n\nA/P:  Abdominal pain, unclear etiology.  I expressed my doubt that her pain was secondary to this 1.9-cm ovarian cyst given the fact that there was no free fluid surrounding this.  However, given that she has irregular periods and they are painful for her, I think it is reasonable to start her on a low-dose birth control pill.  She has no personal or familial contraindications to start this.  She was given a prescription for Lo/Ovral, dispensed 30 with refill x 4.  She will come back in six weeks for blood pressure check as well as in six months to followup on her pain and her bleeding patterns.\n\nIf she should have the recurrence of her pain, I have advised her to call.

This patient has chronic kidney disease stage 4 with an estimated creatinine clearance of 23 mL/minute.  I unsure whether this renal failure is recent or she has had slow progression of her renal failure.  I would appreciate it if you could forward the results of any laboratory tests done in the last two to three years to determine her creatinine.  I am unsure of the exact etiology of her renal failure.  I ordered a renal ultrasound to evaluate the kidney size and also to evaluate if she has been emptying her bladder completely.  The patient does report that she has dribbling of urine and some incontinence.  Also, I ordered a comprehensive metabolic panel, CBC, intact PTH, hepatitis B and C panel, and a 24-hour urine for protein and creatinine clearance.  The patient has had recurrent UTIs in the past and it is possible that she has had chronic pyelonephritis and scarring resulting in chronic renal failure.  She has a urinary tract infection currently with multiple WBCs on the microscopy.  I prescribed ciprofloxacin 250 mg q.d. for 10 days and we will send her urine out for cultures, and we adjust her antibiotics if her urine cultures shows resistant organisms.  I explained to the patient that if her renal function continues to worsen we might need to discuss renal replacement therapy with regards to either transplantation or dialysis.  We will address this issue after the results are available.  I also ordered a postvoid residual to see if she is emptying her bladder completely.  I have advised her not to use any nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.  \n2.    Hypertension.  Blood pressure is controlled off medications.  We will reevaluate the blood pressure     \n       on the next visit.  \n3.    Urinary tract infection.  Prescribed Cipro 250 mg q.d. pending cultures.\n4.    Chronic diarrhea.  The patient states she has tried multiple agents with no relief of the diarrhea.  \n5.    Chronic hypokalemia.  The patient has been advised to call in with the potassium dose.  \n6.    Follow up in six weeks.

This patient may have had reactive arthritis.  \n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nHISTORY:  We had the pleasure of seeing the patient today in our Pediatric Rheumatology Clinic.  He was sent here with a chief complaint of joint pain in several joints for few months.  This is a 7-year-old white male who has no history of systemic disease, who until 2 months ago, was doing well and 2 months ago, he started to complain of pain in his fingers, elbows, and neck.  At this moment, this is better and is almost gone, but for several months, he was having pain to the point that he would cry at some point.  He is not a complainer according to his mom and he is a very active kid.  There is no history of previous illness to this or had gastrointestinal problems.  He has problems with allergies, especially seasonal allergies and he takes Claritin for it.  Other than that, he has not had any other problem.  Denies any swelling except for that doctor mentioned swelling on his elbow.  There is no history of rash, no stomach pain, no diarrhea, no fevers, no weight loss, no ulcers in his mouth except for canker sores.  No lymphadenopathy, no eye problems, and no urinary problems.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  His medications consist only of Motrin only as needed and Claritin currently for seasonal allergies and rhinitis.\n\nALLERGIES:  He has no allergies to any drugs.\n\nBIRTH HISTORY:  Pregnancy and delivery with no complications.  He has no history of hospitalizations or surgeries.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for arthritis in his grandmother.  No history of pediatric arthritis.  There is history of psoriasis in his dad.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with mom, dad, brother, sister, and everybody is healthy.  They live in Easton.  They have 4 dogs, 3 cats, 3 mules and no deer.  At school, he is in second grade and he is doing PE without any limitation.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: \nVITAL SIGNS:  Temperature is 98.7, pulse is 96, respiratory rate is 24, height is 118.1 cm, weight is 22.1 kg, and blood pressure is 61/44.\nGENERAL:  He is alert, active, in no distress, very cooperative.\nHEENT:  He has no facial rash.  No lymphadenopathy.  Oral mucosa is clear.  No tonsillitis.  His ear canals are clear and pupils are reactive to light and accommodation.\nCHEST:  Clear to auscultation.\nHEART:  Regular rhythm and no murmur.\nABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender with no visceromegaly.\nMUSCULOSKELETAL:  Shows no limitation in any of his joints or active swelling today.  He has no tenderness either in any of his joints.  Muscle strength is 5/5 in proximal muscles.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Includes an arthritis panel.  It has normal uric acid, sedimentation rate of 2, rheumatoid factor of 6, and antinuclear antibody that is negative and C-reactive protein that is 7.1.  His mother stated that this was done while he was having symptoms.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This patient may have had reactive arthritis.  He is seen frequently and the patient has family history of psoriatic arthritis or psoriasis.  I do not see any problems at this moment on his laboratories or on his physical examination.  This may have been related to recent episode of viral infection or infection of some sort.  Mother was oriented about the finding and my recommendation is to observe him and if there is any recurrence of the symptoms or persistence of swelling or limitation in any of his joints, I will be glad to see him back.\n\nIf you have any question on further assessment and plan, please do no hesitate to contact us.

Primary low transverse cesarean section.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nFINAL DIAGNOSES:  Delivered pregnancy, cholestasis of pregnancy, fetal intolerance to labor, failure to progress.\n\nPROCEDURE:  Included primary low transverse cesarean section.\n\nSUMMARY:  This 32-year-old gravida 2 was induced for cholestasis of pregnancy at 38-1/2 weeks.  The patient underwent a 2-day induction.  On the second day, the patient continued to progress all the way to the point of 9.5 cm at which point, she failed to progress.  During the hour or two of evaluation at 9.5 cm, the patient was also noted to have some fetal tachycardia and an occasional late deceleration.  Secondary to these factors, the patient was brought to the operative suite for primary low transverse cesarean section, which she underwent without significant complication.  There was a slightly enlarged blood loss at approximately 1200 mL, and postoperatively, the patient was noted to have a very mild tachycardia coupled with 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit temperature right at delivery.  It was felt that this was a sign of very early chorioamnionitis and therapeutic antibiotics were given throughout her stay.  The patient received 72 hours of antibiotics with there never being a temperature above 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit.  The maternal tachycardia resolved within a day.  The patient did well throughout the 3-day stay progressing to full diet, regular bowel movements, normal urination patterns.  The patient did receive 2 units of packed red cells on Sunday when attended to by my partner secondary to a hematocrit of 20%.  It should be noted, however, that this was actually an expected result with the initial hematocrit of 32% preoperatively.  Therefore, there was anemia but not an unexplained anemia.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  Includes the stable vital signs, afebrile state.  An alert and oriented patient who is desirous at discharge.  Full range of motion, all extremities; fully ambulatory.  Pulse is regular and strong.  Lungs are clear and the abdomen is soft and nontender with minimal tympany and a nontender fundus.  The incision is beautiful and soft and nontender.  There is scant lochia and there is minimal edema.\n\nLABORATORY STUDIES:  Include hematocrit of 27% and the last liver function tests was within normal limits 48 hours prior to discharge.\n\nFOLLOWUP:  For the patient includes pelvic rest, regular diet.  Follow up with me in 1 to 2 weeks.  Motrin 800 mg p.o. q.8h. p.r.n. cramps, Tylenol No.  3 one p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain, prenatal vitamin one p.o. daily, and topical triple antibiotic to incision b.i.d. to q.i.d.

Acute kidney injury of which etiology is unknown at this time, with progressive azotemia unresponsive to IV fluids.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nREASON FOR CONSULTATION:  Renal failure evaluation for possible dialysis therapy.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 47-year-old gentleman, who works offshore as a cook, who about 4 days ago noted that he was having some swelling in his ankles and it progressively got worse over the past 3 to 4 days, until he was swelling all the way up to his mid thigh bilaterally.  He also felt like he could not make much urine, and his wife, who is a nurse instructed him to force fluids.  While he was there, he was drinking cranberry juice, some Powerade, but he also has a history of weightlifting and had been taking on a creatine protein drink on a daily basis for some time now.  He presented here with very decreased urine output until a Foley catheter was placed and about 500 mL was noted in his bladder.  He did have a CPK level of about 234 while his BUN and creatinine on admission were 109 and 6.9.  Despite IV hydration fluids, his potassium has gone up from 5.4 to 6.1.  He did not put out any significant urine and his weight was documented at 103 kg.  He was given a dose of Kayexalate.  His potassium came down to like about 5.9 and urine studies were ordered.  His urinalysis did show that he had microscopic hematuria and proteinuria and his protein-creatinine ratio was about 9 gm of protein consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria.  He did have a low albumin of 1.9.  He denied any nonsteroidal usage, any recreational drug abuse, and his urine drug screen was unremarkable, and he denied any history of hypertension or any other medical problems.  He has not had any blood work except for drug screens that are required by work and no work up by any primary care physician because he has not seen one for primary care.  He is very concerned because his mother and father were both on dialysis, which he thinks were due to diabetes and both parents have expired.  He denied any hemoptysis, gross hematuria, melena, hematochezia, hemoptysis, hematemesis, no seizures, no palpitations, no pruritus, no chest pain.  He did have a decrease in his appetite, which all started about Thursday.  We were asked to see this patient in consultation by Dr. X because of his renal failure and the need for possible dialysis therapy.  He was significantly hypertensive on admission with a blood pressure of 162/80.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Unremarkable.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Unremarkable.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Both mother and father were on dialysis of end-stage renal disease.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  He is married.  He does smoke despite understanding the risks associated with smoking a pack every 6 days.  Does not drink alcohol or use any recreational drug use.  He was on no prescribed medications.  He did have a fairly normal PSA of about 119 and I had ordered a renal ultrasound which showed fairly normal-sized kidneys and no evidence of hydronephrosis or mass, but it was consistent with increased echogenicity in the cortex, findings representative of medical renal disease.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nVital signs:  Blood pressure is 153/77, pulse 66, respiration 18, temperature 98.5.\nGeneral:  He was alert and oriented x 3, in no apparent distress, well-developed male.\nHEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular muscles intact.\nNeck:  Supple.  No JVD, adenopathy, or bruit.\nChest:  Clear to auscultation.\nHeart:  Regular rate and rhythm without a rub.\nAbdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.\nExtremities:  Showed no clubbing, cyanosis.  He did have 2+ pretibial edema in both lower extremities.\nNeurologic:  No gross focal findings.\nSkin:  Showed no active skin lesions.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 138, potassium 6.1, chloride 108, CO2 22, glucose 116, BUN 111, creatinine 7.29, estimated GFR 10 mL/minute.  Calcium 7.4 with an albumin of 1.9.  Mag normal at 2.2.  Urine culture negative at 12 hours.  His Random urine sodium was low at 12.  Random urine protein was 4756, and creatinine in the urine was 538.  Urine drug screen was unremarkable.  Troponin was within normal limits.  Phosphorus slightly elevated at 5.7.  CPK level was 234, white blood cells 6.5, hemoglobin 12.2, platelet count 188,000 with 75% segs.  PT 10.0, INR 1.0, PTT at 27.3.  B-natriuretic peptide 718.  Urinalysis showed 3+ protein, 4+ blood, negative nitrites, and trace leukocytes, 5 to 10 wbc's, greater than 100 rbc's, occasional fine granular casts, and moderate transitional cells.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1.  Acute kidney injury of which etiology is unknown at this time, with progressive azotemia unresponsive to IV fluids.\n2.  Hyperkalemia due to renal failure, slowly improving with Kayexalate.\n3.  Microscopic hematuria with nephrotic range proteinuria, more consistent with a glomerulonephropathy nephritis.\n4.  Hypertension.\n\nPLAN:  I will give him Kayexalate 15 gm p.o. q.6h. x 2 more doses since he is responding and his potassium is already down to 5.2.  I will also recheck a urinalysis, consult the surgeon in the morning for temporary hemodialysis catheter placement, and consult case managers to start work on a transfer to ABCD Center per the patient and his wife's request, which will occur after his second dialysis treatment if he remains stable.  We will get a BMP, phosphorus, mag, CBC in the morning since he was given 80 mg of Lasix for fluid retention.  We will also give him 10 mg of Zaroxolyn p.o.  Discontinue all IV fluids.  Check an ANCA hepatitis profile, C3 and C4 complement levels along with CH 50 level.  I did discuss with the patient and his wife the need for kidney biopsy and they would like the kidney biopsy to be performed closer to home at Ochsner where his family is, since he only showed up here because of the nearest hospital located to his offshore job.  I do agree with getting him transferred once he is stable from his hyperkalemia and he starts his dialysis.\n\nI appreciate consult.  I did discuss with him the importance of the kidney biopsies to direct treatment, finding the underlying etiology of his acute renal failure and to also give him prognostic factors of renal recovery.

Punched the wall 3 days prior to presentation, complained of ulnar-sided right hand pain, and was seen in the emergency room. \n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nREASON FOR VISIT:  New patient visit for right hand pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 28-year-old right-hand dominant gentleman, who punched the wall 3 days prior to presentation.  He complained of ulnar-sided right hand pain and was seen in the emergency room.  Reportedly, he had some joints in his hand pushed back and placed by somebody in emergency room.  Today, he admits that his pain is much better.  Currently, since that time he has been in the splint with minimal pain.  He has had no numbness, tingling or other concerning symptoms.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Negative.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a nonsmoker and does not use illegal drugs.  Occasionally drinks.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  A 12-point review of systems is negative.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  None.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\nFINDINGS:  On physical exam, he has swelling and tenderness over the ulnar dorsum of his hand.  He has a normal cascade.  He has 70 degrees of MCP flexion and full IP flexion and extension.  He has 3 to 5 strength in his grip and intrinsics.  He has intact sensation to light touch in the radial, ulnar, and median nerve distribution.  Two plus radial pulse.\n\nX-rays taken from today were reviewed, include three views of the right hand.  They show possible small fractures of the base of the fourth and third metacarpals.  Joint appears to be located.  A 45-degree oblique view was obtained and confirmed adduction of the CMC joints of the fourth and fifth metacarpals.  His injury films from 09/15/07 were reviewed and demonstrated what appears to be CMC dislocations of the third and fourth metacarpals.\n\nASSESSMENT:  Status post right third and fourth metacarpal carpometacarpal dislocations.\n\nPLANS:  The patient was placed into a short-arm cast and intrinsic plus.  I would like him to wear this for 2 weeks and then follow up with us.  At that time, we will transition him to an OT splint and begin range of motion activities of the fingers and wrist.  We should see him back in 2 weeks' time at which time he should obtain three views of the right hand and a 45-degree oblique view out of cast.

It was felt to be stage 2.  It was not N-Myc amplified and had favorable Shimada histology.  In followup, he was found to have a second primary in his right adrenal gland, which was biopsied and also consistent with neuroblastoma with favorable Shimada histology.  He is now being treated with chemotherapy per protocol P9641 and not on study.  He last received chemotherapy on 05/21/07, with carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin.  He received G-CSF daily after his chemotherapy due to neutropenia that delayed his second cycle.  In the interval since he was last seen, his mother reports that he had a couple of days of nasal congestion, but it is now improving.  He is not acted ill or had any fevers.  He has had somewhat diminished appetite, but it seems to be improving now.  He is peeing and pooping normally and has not had any diarrhea.  He did not have any appreciated nausea or vomiting.  He has been restarted on fluconazole due to having redeveloped thrush recently.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The following systems reviewed and negative per pathology except as noted above.

The patient will return to the Pediatric Oncology Clinic on 06/13/07 to 06/15/07 for his third cycle of chemotherapy.  I will plan for restaging with CT of the abdomen prior to the cycle.\n2.  Immunosuppression.  The patient will continue on his Bactrim twice a day on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  Additionally, we will tentatively plan to have him continue fluconazole since this is his second episode of thrush.\n3.  Mucosal candidiasis.  We will continue fluconazole for thrush.  I am pleased that the clinical evidence of disease appears to have resolved.  For resolving neutropenia, I advised Gregory's mother about it is okay to discontinue the G-CSF at this time.  We will plan for him to resume G-CSF after his next chemotherapy and prescription has been sent to the patient's pharmacy.\n\nPEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY ATTENDING:  I have reviewed the history of the patient.  This is an 11-month-old with neuroblastoma who received chemotherapy with carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin on 05/21/07 for cycle 2 of POG-9641 due to his prior history of neutropenia, he has been on G-CSF.

She has a history of rheumatoid arthritis for the last 6 years.  She was followed by another rheumatologist.  She says she has been off and on, on prednisone and Arava.  The rheumatologist, as per the patient, would not want her to be on a long-term medicine, so he would give her prednisone and then switch to Arava and then switch her back to prednisone.  She says she had been on prednisone for the last 6 to 9 months.  She is on 5 mg a day.  She recently had a left BKA and there was a question of infection, so it had to be debrided.  I was consulted to see if her prednisone is to be continued.  The patient denies any joint pains at the present time.  She says when this started she had significant joint pains and was unable to walk.  She had pain in the hands and feet.  Currently, she has no pain in any of her joints.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Denies photosensitivity, oral or nasal ulcer, seizure, psychosis, and skin rashes.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and left BKA.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Denies tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nVITAL SIGNS:  BP 130/70, heart rate 80, and respiratory rate 14.\nHEENT:  EOMI.

No organomegaly.\nEXTREMITIES:  No edema.\nNEUROLOGIC:  Deferred.\nARTICULAR:  She has swelling of bilateral wrists, but no significant tenderness.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Labs in chart was reviewed.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 71-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, on longstanding prednisone.  She is not on DMARD, but as she recently had a surgery followed by a probable infection, I will hold off on that.  As she has no pain, I have decreased the prednisone to 2.5 mg a day starting tomorrow if she is to go back to her nursing home tomorrow.  If in a couple of weeks her symptoms stay the same, then I would discontinue the prednisone.  I would defer that to Dr. X.  If she flares up at that point, prednisone may have to be restarted with a DMARD, so that eventually she could stay off the prednisone.  I discussed this at length with the patient and she is in full agreement with the plan.  I explained to her that if she is to be discharged, if she wishes, she could follow up with me in clinic or if she goes back to Victoria, then see her rheumatologist over there.

He spontaneously voided without the Foley 110 mL.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 66-year-old male with signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, who has had recurrent urinary retention since the kidney transplant in 12/07.  He passed his fill and pull study and was thought to self-catheterize in the event that he does incur urinary retention again.  We discussed with Mr. Barker that he has a urologist closer to his home and he lives approximately 3 hours away; however, he desires to continue follow up with the urology clinic at MCG and has been set up for followup in 6 weeks.  He was also given a prescription for 6 months of Flomax and Proscar.  He did not have a PSA drawn today as he had a catheter in place, therefore his PSA could be falsely elevated.  He will have PSA level drawn either just before his visit for followup.

The patient complains of fatigue, nausea, vomiting and fever.  The patient states that the shunt was placed in February, although according to medical records it was placed in April and it has been periodically clogging since its placement.  The patient had dialysis today, which is Saturday, for approximately one hour before the shunt no longer worked.  The patient had been seen in the Emergency Room yesterday, 08/29/03, by Dr. X for the same problem.  At that time, Dr. X felt that the patient should use the AV fistula during dialysis and after the fistula is able to be used, the PermCath on the right subclavian should be removed.  As mentioned above, he had dialysis today and they were unable to use AV fistula as well as the PermCath read &quot;did not work&quot;.  The patient has had dialysis since January secondary to hypertension-induced renal failure.  He takes dialysis Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at the ABCD Dialysis Center.  He also was seen at XYZ and he had an apparent thrombectomy with reversal done a few days ago.  The patient's history at this point is a little sketchy; however, he states that he left AMA.

She last saw Dr. X in clinic towards the beginning of this month.  She has been receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin, and she receives three cycles of this with the last one being given on 12/15/08.  She was last seen in clinic on 12/22/08 by Dr. Y.  At that point, her white count was 0.9 with the hemoglobin of 10.3, hematocrit of 30%, and platelets of 81,000.  Her ANC was 0.5.  She was started on prophylactic Augmentin as well as Neupogen shots.  She has also had history of recurrent pleural effusions with the knee for thoracentesis.  She had two of these performed in November and the last one was done about a week ago.\n\nOver the last 2 or 3 days, she states she has been getting more short of breath.  Her history is somewhat limited today as she is very tired and falls asleep readily.  Her history comes from herself but also from the review of the records.  Overall, her shortness of breath has been going on for the past few weeks related to her pleural effusions.  She was seen in the emergency room this time and on chest x-ray was found to have a new right-sided pulmonic consolidative infiltrate, which was felt to be possibly related to pneumonia.  She specifically denied any fevers or chills.  However, she was complaining of chest pain.  She states that the chest pain was located in the substernal area, described as aching, coming and going and associated with shortness of breath and cough.  When she did cough, it was nonproductive.  While in the emergency room on examination, her vital signs were stable except that she required 5 liters nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturations.  An EKG was performed, which showed sinus rhythm without any evidence of Q waves or other ischemic changes.  The chest x-ray described above showed a right lower lobe infiltrate.  A V/Q scan was done, which showed a small mismatched defect in the left upper lobe and a mass defect in the right upper lobe.  The findings were compatible with an indeterminate study for a pulmonary embolism.  Apparently, an ultrasound of the lower extremities was done and was negative for DVT.  There was apparently still some concern that this might be pulmonary embolism and she was started on Lovenox.  There was also concern for pneumonia and she was started on Zosyn as well as vancomycin and admitted to the hospital.\n\nAt this point, we have been consulted to help follow along with this patient who is well known to our clinic.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY\n1.  Ovarian cancer - This was initially diagnosed about 10 years ago and treated with surgical resection including TAH and BSO.  This has recurred over the last couple of months with metastatic disease.\n2.  History of breast cancer - She has been treated with bilateral mastectomy with the first one about 14 years and the second one about 5 years ago.  She has had no recurrent disease.\n3.  Renal cell carcinoma - She is status post nephrectomy.\n4.  Hypertension.\n5.  Anxiety disorder.\n6.  Chronic pain from neuropathy secondary to chemotherapy from breast cancer treatment.\n7.  Ongoing tobacco use.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY\n1.  Recent and multiple thoracentesis as described above.\n2.  Bilateral mastectomies.\n3.  Multiple abdominal surgeries.\n4.  Cholecystectomy.\n5.  Remote right ankle fracture.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  At home,\n1.  Atenolol 50 mg daily\n2.  Ativan p.r.n.\n3.  Clonidine 0.1 mg nightly.\n4.  Compazine p.r.n.\n5.

Zofran p.r.n.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She smokes about 6-7 cigarettes per day and has done so for more than 50 years.  She quit smoking about 6 weeks ago.  She occasionally has alcohol.  She is married and has 3 children.  She lives at home with her husband.  She used to work as a unit clerk at XYZ Medical Center.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Both her mother and father had a history of lung cancer and both were smokers.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  GENERAL/CONSTITUTIONAL:  She has not had any fever, chills, night sweats, but has had fatigue and weight loss of unspecified amount.  HEENT:  She has not had trouble with headaches; mouth, jaw, or teeth pain; change in vision; double vision; or loss of hearing or ringing in her ears.  CHEST:  Per the HPI, she has had some increasing dyspnea, shortness of breath with exertion, cough, but no sputum production or hemoptysis.  CVS:  She has had the episodes of chest pains as described above but has not had, PND, orthopnea lower extremity swelling or palpitations.  GI:  No heartburn, odynophagia, dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, blood in her stool, and black tarry stools.  GU:  No dysuria, burning with urination, kidney stones, and difficulty voiding.  MUSCULOSKELETAL:  No new back pain, hip pain, rib pain, swollen joints, history of gout, or muscle weakness.  NEUROLOGIC:  She has been diffusely weak but no lateralizing loss of strength or feeling.  She has some chronic neuropathic pain and numbness as described above in the past medical history.  She is fatigued and tired today and falls asleep while talking but is easily arousable.  Some of this is related to her lack of sleep over the admission thus far.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\nVITAL SIGNS:  Her T-max is 99.3.  Her pulse is 54, her respirations is 12, and blood pressure 118/61.\nGENERAL:  Somewhat fatigued appearing but in no acute distress.\nHEENT:  NC/AT.  Sclerae anicteric.  Conjunctiva clear.  Oropharynx is clear without any erythema, exudate, or discharge.\nNECK:  Supple.  Nontender.  No elevated JVP.  No thyromegaly.  No thyroid nodules.\nCHEST:  Clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally with decreased breath sounds on the right.\nCVS:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Normal S1 and S2.  No S3 or S4.\nABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Normoactive bowel sounds.  No guarding or rebound.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  No masses.\nMUSCULOSKELETAL:  Generalized muscle weakness but no joint swelling or other abnormalities.\nSKIN:  No rashes, bruising, or petechia.  No non-healing wounds or ulcerations.\nNEUROLOGIC:  She is oriented x3 but she falls asleep readily.  On exam and conversation, her cranial nerves are intact.  She has no sensory loss.  Her strength is symmetric.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Her white blood cell count is 8.0, hemoglobin 11.1, hematocrit 33.2%, and platelets 29,000.  Her differential shows 2% metamyelocytes, 57% neutrophils, 29% bands, 6% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, and 1% eosinophils.  Her sodium is 138, potassium 4.0, chloride 101, CO2 of 23, BUN 21, creatinine 1.4, glucose 107, and calcium 8.7.  Her INR is 1.0, PT of 12, and PTT 24.  Urinalysis negative for nitrite and leukocyte esterase with moderate epithelial cells, bacteria, white blood cells, and yeast suggesting of contamination.  Her troponins have been negative x3.\n\nIMAGINING DATA:  CT scan of her chest on 12/25/08 shows bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right than the left but these are somewhat decreased in size compared to the prior CT scan at the end of November.  There is some consolidative atelectasis at the bilateral basis.  There is some peripheral interstitial opacifications noted in the right lung and to a lesser extent in the left lung possibly consistent with pneumonitis.  There are small peripheral nodular densities in both lungs unchanged compared to prior scan.  There is an enlarged right adrenal gland again noted without change.\n\nASSESSMENT:  ABCD is a very pleasant 66-year-old woman with recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer known to our clinic.  At this point, she has been admitted for shortness of breath with possible presumed pneumonia.  The possibility of a PE also remains and the plan has been to do a CTA once her kidney function improves.  Currently, she is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and Lovenox prophylactically.\n\nAt this point, it does not appear that her pleural effusions have increased and this would not be the etiology behind her worsening symptoms.  Her blood counts appear to be recovering from chemotherapy except for the fact that her platelets have gone lower.  It is unclear as to the etiology behind this but may still be related to chemotherapy effect.  This also could be related to consumptive process such as DIC in the face of infections or medication effect.  We will keep track of her blood counts over this admission.\n\nWe will continue to follow along through the course of her admission.  She has requested being full code.  I went back and looked at Dr. X's chart after our clinic chart and at the last visit with Dr. X and Dr. Y, she confirmed that she wanted to be DNR/DNI.  I am not sure why this is changed and I will address this issue with her once she is more alert.\n\nThank you very much for this consult.

At the time of my exam, he states that his left lower extremity pain has improved considerably.  He apparently had more significant paresthesias in the past and now he feels that the paresthesias have improved considerably.  He does have a history of multiple medical problems including atrial fibrillation, he is on Coumadin, which is currently subtherapeutic, multiple CVAs in the past, peripheral vascular disease, and congestive heart failure.  He has multiple chronic history of previous ischemia of his large bowel in the past.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\nVITAL SIGNS:  Currently his temperature is 98.2, pulse is 95, and blood pressure is 138/98.\nHEENT:  Unremarkable.\nLUNGS:  Clear.\nCARDIOVASCULAR:  An irregular rhythm.\nABDOMEN:  Soft.\nEXTREMITIES:  His upper extremities are well perfused.  He has palpable radial and femoral pulses.  He does not have any palpable pedal pulses in either right or left lower extremity.  He does have reasonable capillary refill in both feet.  He has about one second capillary refill on both the right hand and left lower extremities and his left foot is perhaps little cool, but it is relatively warm.  Apparently, this was lot worst few hours ago.  He describes significant pain and pallor, which he feels has improved and certainly clinically at this point does not appear to be as significant.\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  This gentleman with a history of multiple comorbidities as detailed above had what sounds clinically like acute exacerbation of chronic peripheral vascular disease, essentially related to spasm versus a small clot, which may have been lysed to some extent.  He currently has a viable extremity and viable foot, but certainly has significant making compromised flow.  It is unclear to me whether this is chronic or acute, and whether he is a candidate for any type of intervention.  He certainly would benefit from an angiogram to better to define his anatomy and anticoagulation in the meantime.  Given his potential history of recent lower GI bleeding, he has been evaluated by GI to see whether or not he is a candidate for heparinization.  We will order an angiogram for the next few hours and followup on those results to better define his anatomy and to determine whether or not if any interventions are appropriate.  Again, at this point, he has no pain, relatively rapid capillary refill, and relatively normal motor function suggesting a viable extremity.  We will follow him along closely.

She is being sent for evaluation of ocular manifestations of systemic connective tissue disorders.  She denies any eye problems.  Her past ocular history includes myopia with astigmatism.  She wears contact lenses.  She denies flashes, floaters, or curtains in either eye.\n\nHer past medical history includes a presumed diagnosis of connective tissue disorder.  She has otherwise, good health.  She underwent a shoulder ligament repair for joint laxity.\n\nShe does not take any eye medications and she takes Seasonale systemically.  She is allergic to penicillin.\n\nThe visual acuity today, distance with her current prescription was 20/30 on the right and 20/20 on the left eye.  Over refraction on the right eye showed -0.50 sphere with acuity of 20/20 OD.  She is wearing -3.75 +1.50 x 060 on the right and -2.50 +0.25 x 140, OS.  Intraocular pressures are 13 OU and by applanation.  Confrontation, visual fields, extraocular movement, and pupils are normal in both eyes.  Gonioscopy showed normal anterior segment angle morphology in both eyes.  She does have some fine iris strength crossing the angle, but the angle is otherwise open 360 degrees in both eyes.\n\nThe lids were normal in both eyes.  Conjunctivae were quite, OU.  Cornea were clear in both eyes.  The anterior chamber is deep and quiet, OU.  She has clear lenses, which are in good position, OU.  Dilated fundus exam shows moderately optically clear vitreous, OU.  The optic nerves are normal in size.  The cup-to-disc ratios were approximately 0.4, OU.  The nerve fiber layers are excellent, OU.  The macula, vessels, and periphery were normal in both eyes.  No evidence of peripheral retinal degeneration is present in either eye.\n\nMs. ABC has optically clear vitreous.  She does not have any obvious risk factors for retinal detachment at present such as peripheral retinal degeneration and her anterior chamber angles are normal in both eyes.\n\nShe does have moderate myopia, however.\n\nThis combination of findings suggests and is consistent with her systemic connective tissue disorder such as a Stickler syndrome or a variant of Stickler syndrome.\n\nI discussed with her the symptoms of retinal detachment and advised her to contact us immediately if they occur.  Otherwise, I can see her in 1 to 2 years.

A 51-year-old lady for mastectomy on the right side, who is interested in the possibility of breast reconstruction.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nREASON FOR CONSULTATION:  Breast reconstruction post mastectomy.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51-year-old lady, who had gone many years without a mammogram when she discovered a lump in her right breast early in February of this year.  She brought this to the attention of her primary care doctor and she soon underwent ultrasound and mammogram followed by needle biopsy, which revealed that there was breast cancer.  This apparently was positive in two separate locations within the suspicious area.  She also underwent MRI, which suggested that there was significant size to the area involved.  Her contralateral left breast appeared to be uninvolved.  She has had consultation with Dr. ABC and they are currently in place to perform a right mastectomy.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Positive for hypertension, which is controlled on medications.  She is a nonsmoker and engages in alcohol only moderately.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Surgical history includes uterine fibroids, some kind of cyst excision on her foot, and cataract surgery.\n\nALLERGIES:  None known.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Lipitor, ramipril, Lasix, and potassium.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient is a healthy looking 51-year-old lady, who is moderately overweight.  Breast exam reveals significant breast hypertrophy bilaterally with a double D breast size and significant shoulder grooving from her bra straps.  There are no any significant scars on the right breast as she has only undergone needle biopsy at this point.  Exam also reveals abdomen where there is moderate excessive fat, but what I consider a good morphology for a potential TRAM flap.\n\nIMPRESSION:  A 51-year-old lady for mastectomy on the right side, who is interested in the possibility of breast reconstruction.  We discussed the breast reconstruction options in some detail including immediate versus delayed reconstruction and autologous tissue versus implant reconstruction.  I think for a lady of this physical size and breast morphology that the likelihood of getting a good result with a tissue expander reconstruction is rather slim.  A further complicating factor is the fact that she may well be undergoing radiation after her mastectomy.  I would think this would make a simple tissue expander reconstruction virtually beyond the balance of consideration.  I have occasionally gotten away with tissue expanders with reasonable results in irradiated patients when they are thinner and smaller breasted, but in a heavier lady with large breasts, I think it virtually deemed to failure.  We therefore, mostly confine our discussion to the relative merits of TRAM flap breast reconstruction and latissimus dorsi reconstruction with implant.  In either case, the contralateral breast reduction would be part of the overall plan.\n \nThe patient understands that the TRAM flap although not much more lengthy of a procedure is a little comfortable recovery.  Since we are sacrificing a rectus abdominus muscle that can be more discomfort and difficulties in healing both due to it being a respiratory muscle and to its importance in sitting up and getting out of bed.  In any case, she does prefer this option in order to avoid the need for an implant.  We discussed pros and cons of the surgery, including the risks such as infection, bleeding, scarring, hernia, or bulging of the donor site, seroma of the abdomen, and fat necrosis or even the skin slough in the abdomen.  We also discussed some of the potential flap complications including partial or complete necrosis of the TRAM flap itself.\n\nPLAN:  The patient is definitely interested in undergoing TRAM flap reconstruction.  At the moment, we are planning to do it as an immediate reconstruction at the time of the mastectomy.  For this reason, I have made arrangements to do initial vascular delay procedure within the next couple of days.  We may cancel this if the chance of postoperative irradiation is high.  If this is the case, I think we can do a better job on the reconstruction if we defer it.  The patient understands this and will proceed according to the recommendations from Dr. ABC and from the oncologist.

In the past two months she has developed blurred vision and a central scotoma OD. There are no symptoms of photopsias, diplopia, headache, or eye pain. There are no other complaints. There have been mild fluctuations of her symptoms, but her vision has never returned to its baseline prior to symptom onset one year ago.\n\nEXAM: Visual acuity with correction: 20/25+1 OD; 20/20-1 OS. Pupils were 3.5mm OU. There was a 0.8 log unit RAPD OD. Intraocular pressures were 25 and 24, OD and OS respectively; and there was an increase to 27 on upgaze OD, but no increase on upgaze OS. Optic disk pallor was evident OD, but not OS. Additionally, there was a small area of peripheral chorioretinal scarring in the inferotemporal area of the right eye. Foveal flicker fusion occurred at a frequency of 21.9 OD and 30.7 OS. Color plate testing scores: 6/14 OD and 10/14 OS. Goldman visual field examination showed an enlarged and deepened blind spot with an infero-temporal defect especially in the smaller diopters.\n\nIMPRESSION ON 2/6/89: Optic neuropathy/atrophy OD, rule out mass lesion affecting optic nerve. Particular attention was paid to the area of the optic canal, cavernous sinus and sphenoid sinus.\n\nBRAIN CT W/CONTRAST, 2/13/89: Enhancing calcified lesion in the posterior aspect of the right optic nerve, probable meningioma.\n\nMRI ORBITS W/ AND W/OUT GADOLINIUM CONTRAST, 4/26/89: 7x3mm irregular soft tissue mass just inferior and lateral to the optic nerve OD. The mass is just proximal to the orbital apex. There is relatively homogeneous enhancement of the mass. The findings are most consistent with meningioma.\n\nMRI 1995: Mild enlargement of tumor with possible slight extension into the right cavernous sinus.\n\nCOURSE: Resection and biopsy were deferred due to risk of blindness, and suspicion that the tumor was a slow growing meningioma. 3 years after initial evaluation Hertel measurements indicated a 3mm proptosis OD. Visual field testing revealed gradual worsening of deficits seen on her initial Goldman visual field exam. There was greater red color desaturation of the temporal field OD. Visual acuity had decreased from 20/20 to 20/64, OD. All other deficits seen on her initial exam remained stable or slightly worsened. By 1996 she continued to be followed at 6 months intervals and had not undergone surgical resection.

The patient reports that she has worked hard for a number of weeks following the meal plan prescribed, but felt like she was gaining weight and not losing weight on it.  She is not sure that she was following it accurately.  She is trying to walk 1-1/2 to 2 miles every other day, but is increasing her time in the garden and doing other yard work as well.  Once she started experiencing some weight gain, she went back to her old South Beach Diet and felt like she was able to take some of that weight off.  However she realizes that the South Beach Diet is not a healthy diet for her and so is coming back for better instruction on safe weight loss and low-fat eating.\n\nOBJECTIVE:  Weight is 275 pounds.  Food records were reviewed.\n\nASSESSMENT:  The patient experienced a weight gain of 2 pounds since our last consultation which was two months ago.  I did carefully review her food records and evaluated calories consumed.  While she was carefully tracking the volume of protein and carbohydrates, she was getting some excess calories from the fatty proteins selected.  Thus we rearranged her meal plan a little bit and talked about how to track her fat calories as well.  She was more open to reducing the amount of protein from the previous meal plan and increasing slightly the amount of carbohydrates.  While this still is not as much carbohydrate as I would normally recommend, I am certainly willing to work with her on how she feels her body best handles weight reduction.  We also discussed a snack that could be eliminated in the morning because she really is not hungry at that time.\n\nPLAN:  A new 1500 calorie meal plan was developed based on 35% of the calories coming from protein, 40% of the calories from carbohydrate, and 25% of the calories from fat.  This translates in to 10 servings at 15 grams a piece of carbohydrates throughout the day dividing them in to groups of two servings per meal and per snack.  This also translates in to 2 ounces of protein at breakfast, 6 ounces at lunch, 2 ounces in the afternoon snack, 6 ounces at supper, and 2 ounces in the evening snack.  We have eliminated the morning snack.  The patient will now track the grams of fat in her meats as well as added fats.  Her goal for total fats over the course of the day is no more than 42 grams of fat per day.  This was a half hour consultation.  We will plan to see the patient back in one month for support.

The patient started improving his diet when he received the letter explaining his lipids are elevated.  He is consuming less cappuccino, quiche, crescents, candy from vending machines, etc.  He has started packing his lunch three to four times per week instead of eating out so much.  He is exercising six to seven days per week by swimming, biking, running, lifting weights one and a half to two and a half hours each time.  He is in training for a triathlon.  He says he is already losing weight due to his efforts.\n\nOBJECTIVE:  Height:  6 foot 2 inches.  Weight:  204 pounds on 03/07/05.  Ideal body weight:  190 pounds, plus or minus ten percent.  He is 107 percent standard of midpoint ideal body weight.  BMI:  26.189.  A 48-year-old male.  Lab on 03/15/05:  Cholesterol:  251.  LDL:  166.  VLDL:  17.  HDL:  68.  Triglycerides:  87.  I explained to the patient the dietary guidelines to help improve his lipids.  I recommend a 26 to 51 to 77 fat grams per day for a 10 to 20 to 30 percent fat level of 2,300 calories since he is interested in losing weight.  I went over the printed information sheet on lowering your cholesterol and that was given to him along with a booklet on the same topic to read.  I encouraged him to continue as he is doing.\n\nASSESSMENT:  Basal energy expenditure 1960 x 1.44 activity factor is approximately 2,800 calories.  His 24-hour recall shows he is making many positive changes already to lower his fat and cholesterol intake.  He needs to continue as he is doing.  He verbalized understanding and seemed receptive.\n\nPLAN:  The patient plans to recheck his lipids through Dr. XYZ  I gave him my phone number and he is to call me if he has any further questions regarding his diet.

The patient says she stays active by walking at the mall.\n\nOBJECTIVE:  Weight today is 201 pounds, which is down 3 pounds in the past month.  She has lost a total of 24 pounds.  I praised this and encouraged her to continue.  I went over her food diary.  I praised her three-meal pattern and all of her positive food choices, especially the use of sugar-free Kool-Aid, sugar-free Jell-O, sugar-free lemonade, diet pop, as well as the variety of foods she is using in her three-meal pattern.  I encouraged her to continue all of this.\n\nASSESSMENT:  The patient has been successful with weight loss due to assistance from others in keeping a food diary, picking lower-calorie items, her three-meal pattern, getting a balanced diet, and all her physical activity.  She needs to continue all this.\n\nPLAN:  Followup is set for 06/13/05 to check the patient's weight, her food diary, and answer any questions.

She was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 1983.  She is not allergic to any medicines.\n\nDIABETES MEDICATIONS:  Her diabetes medications include Humulin insulin 70/30, 44 units at breakfast and 22 units at supper.  Also metformin 500 mg at supper.\n\nOTHER MEDICATIONS:  Other medications include verapamil, Benicar, Toprol, clonidine, and hydrochlorothiazide.\n\nASSESSMENT:  The patient and her daughter completed both days of diabetes education in a group setting.  Blood glucose records and food diaries are reviewed by the diabetes educator and the dietician.  Fasting blood sugars are 127, 80, and 80.  Two-hour postprandial breakfast reading was 105, two-hour postprandial lunch reading was 88, and two-hour postprandial dinner reading was 73 and 63.  Her diet was excellent.\n\nSeven hours of counseling about diabetes mellitus was provided on this date.\nBlood glucose values obtained at 10 a.m. were 84 and at 2.30 p.m. were 109.  Assessment of her knowledge is completed at the end of the counseling session.  She demonstrated increased knowledge in all areas and had no further questions.  She also completed an evaluation of the class.\n\nThe patient's feet were examined during the education session.  She had flat feet bilaterally.  Skin color was pink, temperature warm.  Pedal pulses 2+.  Her right second and third toes lay on each other.  Also, the same on her left foot.  However, there was no skin breakdown.  She had large bunions, medial aspect of the ball of both feet.  She had positive sensitivity to most areas of her feet, however, she had negative sensitivity to the medial and lateral aspect of the balls of her left foot.\n\nDuring the education session, she set behavioral goals for self care.  First goal is to eat three meals a day and eat three snacks daily to improve her blood glucose levels.  Second goal is to eat a well balanced meal at 1200 calories in order to lose one-half pound of weight per week and improve her blood glucose control.  Third goal is to exercise by walking for 15 to 30 minutes a day, three to five days a week to increase her blood glucose control.  Her success in achieving these goals will be followed in three months by a letter from the diabetes education class.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:  Since she is doing so well with her diet changes, her blood sugars have been within normal limits and sometimes on the low side, especially considering the fact that she has low blood sugar unawareness.  She is to followup with Dr. XYZ for possible reduction in her insulin doses.

She said she is feeling better since she has lost weight.\n\nOBJECTIVE:\nVital Signs:  The patient's weight today is 209 pounds, which is down 22 pounds since I last saw her on 06/07/2004.  I praised her weight loss and her regular exercising.  I looked at her food journal.  I praised her record keeping.  I gave her a list of the diabetic exchanges and explained them.  I also gave her a food dairy sheet so that she could record exchanges.  I encouraged her to continue.\n\nASSESSMENT:  The patient seems happy with her progress and she seems to be doing well.  She needs to continue.\n\nPLAN:  Followup is on a p.r.n. basis.  She is always welcome to call or return.

She reports that she has chest pain at night.  This happened last year exactly the same.  She went to see Dr. Murphy, and he did a treadmill and an echocardiogram, no concerns for cardiovascular disease, and her symptoms resolved now over the last month.  She wakes in the middle of the night and reports that she has a pressure.  It is mild-to-moderate in the middle of her chest and will stay there as long she lies down.  If she gets up, it goes away within 15 minutes.  It is currently been gone on for the last week.  She denies any fast heartbeats or irregular heartbeats at this time.\n2.  She has been having stomach pains that started about a month ago.  This occurs during the daytime.  It has no relationship to foods.  It is mild in nature, located in the mid epigastric area.  It has been better for one week as well.\n3.  She continues to have reflux, has noticed that if she stops taking Aciphex, then she has symptoms.  If she takes her Aciphex, she seems that she has the reflux belching, burping, and heartburn under control.\n4.  She has right flank pain when she lies down.  She has had this off and on for four months.  It is a dull achy pain.  It is mild in nature.\n5.  She has some spots on her shoulder that have been present for a long time, but over the last month have been getting bigger in size and is elevated whereas they had not been elevated in the past.  It is not painful.\n6.  She has had spots in her armpits initially on the right side and then going to the left side.  They are not itchy.\n7.  She is having problems with urgency of urine.  When she has her bladder full, she suddenly has an urge to use the restroom, and sometimes does not make it before she begins leaking.  She is wearing a pad now.\n8.  She is requesting a colonoscopy for screening as well.  She is wanting routine labs for following her chronic leukopenia, also is desiring a hepatitis titer.\n9.  She has had pain in her thumbs when she is trying to do fine motor skills, has noticed this for the last several months.  There has been no swelling or redness or trauma to these areas.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She has recently been to the eye doctor.  She has noticed some hearing loss gradually.  She denies any problems with swallowing.  She denies episodes of shortness of breath, although she has had a little bit of chronic cough.  She has had normal bowel movements.  Denies any black or bloody stools, diarrhea, or constipation.  Denies seeing blood in her urine and has had no urinary problems other than what is stated above.  She has had no problems with edema or lower extremity numbness or tingling.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She works at nursing home.  She is a nonsmoker.  She is currently trying to lose weight.  She is on the diet and has lost several pounds in the last several months.  She quit smoking in 1972.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Her father has type I diabetes and heart disease.  She has a brother who had heart attack at the age of 52.  He is a smoker.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Episodic leukopenia and mild irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Aciphex 20 mg q.d. and aspirin 81 mg q.d.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known medical allergies.\n\nOBJECTIVE:\nVital Signs:  Weight:  142 pounds.  Blood pressure:  132/78.  Pulse:  72.\nGeneral:  This is a well-developed adult female who is awake, alert, and in no acute distress.\nHEENT:  Her pupils are equally round and reactive to light.  Conjunctivae are white.  TMs look normal bilaterally.  Oropharynx appears to be normal.  Dentition is excellent.\nNeck:  Supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.\nLungs:  Clear with normal respiratory effort.\nHeart:  Regular rhythm and rate without murmur.  Radial pulses are normal bilaterally.\nAbdomen:  Soft, nontender, and nondistended without organomegaly.\nExtremities:  Examination of the hands reveals some tenderness at the base of her thumbs bilaterally as well as at the PIP joint and DIP joint.  Her armpits are examined.  She has what appears to be a tinea versicolor rash present in the armpits bilaterally.  She has a lesion on her left shoulder, which is 6 mm in diameter.  It has diffuse borders and is slightly red.  It has two brown spots in it.  In her lower extremities, there is no cyanosis or edema.  Pulses at the radial and posterior tibial pulses are normal bilaterally.  Her gait is normal.\nPsychiatric:  Her affect is pleasant and positive.\nNeurological:  She is grossly intact.  Her speech seems to be clear.  Her coordination of upper and lower extremities is normal.\n\nASSESSMENT/PLAN:\n1.  Chest pain.  At this point, because of Dr. Murphy s evaluation last year and the symptoms exactly the same, I think this is noncardiac.  My intonation is that this is reflux.  I am going have her double her Aciphex or increase it to b.i.d., and I am going to have her see Dr. XYZ for possible EGD if he thinks that would be appropriate.  She is to let me know if her symptoms are getting worse or if she is having any severe episodes.\n2.  Stomach pain, uncertain at this point, but I feel like this is probably related as well to chest pain.\n3.  Suspicious lesions on the left shoulder.  We will do a punch biopsy and set her up for an appointment for that.\n4.  Tinea versicolor in the axillary area.  I have prescribed selenium sulfide lotion to apply 10 minutes a day for seven days.\n5.  Cystocele.  We will have her see Dr. XYZ for further discussion of repair due to her urinary incontinence.\n6.  History of leukopenia.  We will check a CBC.\n7.  Pain in the thumbs, probably arthritic in nature, observe for now.\n8.  Screening.  We will have her see Dr. XYZ for discussion of colon cancer screening.\n9.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.  I have increased Aciphex to b.i.d. for now.

Worker s Compensation Injury\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Worker s compensation injury.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 21-year-old Hispanic female.  She comes in today with her boyfriend.  The patient speaks English fairly well, but her primary language is Spanish.  Her boyfriend does help to make sure that she understands what we are talking about.  The patient seems to understand our conversation fairly well.  She works at Norcraft and injured her right thumb on 09/10/2004 at 12:15 a.m.  She was pushing a cart and mashed her thumb between the cart and the wall.  This was at the finishing room in Norcraft.  She went ahead and went to work yesterday, which was the 14th, but was not able to work on the 13th.  She has swelling in her thumb.  It hurt only if it is pushed on.  It was the distal end of her thumb that was mashed.  She has not noticed any numbness or tingling or weakness.  She has not sought any treatment for this, is not taking any pain medications.  She did try soaking it in warm salt water and did not notice any improvement.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  None.\n\nALLERGIES:  None.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Possible history of chicken pox, otherwise no other medical illnesses.  She has never had any surgery.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Parents and two siblings are healthy.  She has had no children.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is single.  She lives with her boyfriend and his father.  She works at Norcraft.  She wears seatbelt 30% of the time.  I encouraged her to use them all of the time.  She is a nonsmoker, nondrinker.\n\nVACCINATIONS:  She thinks she got a tetanus vaccine in childhood, but does not know for sure.  She does not think she has had a tetanus booster recently.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\nConstitutional:  No fevers, chills, or sweats.\nNeurologic:  She has had no numbness, tingling, or weakness.\nMusculoskeletal:  As above in HPI.  No other difficulties.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nGeneral:  This is a well-developed, well-nourished, very pleasant Hispanic female, in no acute distress.\nVital Signs:  Weight:  121.4.  Blood pressure:  106/78.  Pulse:  64.  Respirations:  20.  Temperature:  96.\nExtremities:  Examination of the right hand reveals the distal end of the thumb to be swollen especially just proximal to the nail bed.  The nail bed is pushed up.  I can see hematoma below the nail bed, although it does appear to be intact.  She has some blue fingernail polish on her nail also, but that is starting to come off.  She is able to bend her thumb normally at the DIP joint.  She has no discomfort doing that.  Sensation is intact over the entire thumb.  She has normal capillary refill.  There is some erythema and swelling noted especially over the posterior thumb just proximal to the nail bed.  I am not feeling any fluctuance.  I do not think it is a collection of pus.  There is no drainage.  She does have some small fissures in the skin where I think she did injure it with this smashing injury, but no deep lacerations at all.  It looks like there may be some mild cellulitis at the site of her injury.\n\nLABORATORY:  X-ray of the thumb was obtained and I do not see any sign of fracture or foreign body.\n\nASSESSMENT:  Blunt trauma to the distal right thumb without fracture.  I think there is some mild cellulitis developing there.\n\nPLAN:\n1.  We will give a tetanus diphtheria booster.\n2.  We will start Keflex 500 mg one p.o. q.i.d. x 7 days.  I would recommend that she can return to work, but she is not to do any work that requires the use of her right thumb.  I would like to see her back on Monday, the 20th in the morning and we can see how her thumb is doing at that time.  If she is noticing any difficulties with increased redness, increased warmth, increased pain, pus-like drainage, or any other difficulties, she is to go ahead and give us a call.  Otherwise I will be seeing her back on Monday.

She has received methotrexate on a weekly basis as an outpatient for many years.  Approximately two weeks ago, she developed a respiratory infection for which she received antibiotics.  She developed some ulcerations of the mouth and was instructed to discontinue the methotrexate approximately ten days ago.  She showed some initial improvement, but over the last 3-5 days has had malaise, a low-grade fever, and severe oral ulcerations with difficulty in swallowing although she can drink liquids with less difficulty.  \n\nThe patient denies any other problems at this point except for a flare of arthritis since discontinuing the methotrexate.  She has rather diffuse pain involving both large and small joints.  \n\nMEDICATIONS: Prednisone 7.5 mg p.o. q.d., Premarin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d., and Dolobid 1000 mg p.o. q.d., recently discontinued because of questionable allergic reaction.  HCTZ 25 mg p.o. q.o.d., Oral calcium supplements.  In the past she has been on penicillin, azathioprine, and hydroxychloroquine, but she has not had Azulfidine, cyclophosphamide, or chlorambucil. \n\nALLERGIES: None by history.  \n\nFAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY: Noncontributory.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: This is a chronically ill appearing female, alert, oriented, and cooperative.  She moves with great difficulty because of fatigue and malaise.  Vital signs: Blood pressure 107/80, heart rate: 100 and regular, respirations 22.  HEENT: Normocephalic. No scalp lesions.  Dry eyes with conjuctival injections.  Mild exophthalmos.  Dry nasal mucosa.  Marked cracking and bleeding of her lips with erosion of the mucosa.  She has a large ulceration of the mucosa at the bite margin on the left.  She has some scattered ulcerations on her hard and soft palette.  Tonsils not enlarged.  No visible exudate.  She has difficulty opening her mouth because of pain.  SKIN: She has some mild ecchymoses on her skin and some erythema; she has patches but no obvious skin breakdown.  She has some fissuring in the buttocks crease.  PULMONARY: Clear to percussion in auscultation.  CARDIOVASCULAR: No murmurs or gallops noted.  ABDOMEN: Protuberant no organomegaly and positive bowel sounds.  NEUROLOGIC EXAM: Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact. Diffuse hyporeflexia.  MUSCULOSKELATAL: Erosive, destructive changes in the elbows, wrist and hands consistent with rheumatoid arthritis.  She also has bilateral total knee replacements with stovepipe legs and parimalleolar pitting adema 1+.  I feel no pulse distally in either leg.  \n\nPROBLEMS: \n1.  Swelling of lips and dysphagia with questionable early Stevens-Johnson syndrome.\n2.  Rheumatoid Arthritis class 3, stage 4.\n3.  Flare of arthritis after discontinuing methotrexate.\n4.  Osteoporosis with compression fracture.\n5.  Mild dehydration.\n6.  Nephrolithiasis.\n\nPLAN: Patient is admitted for IV hydration and treatment of oral ulcerations.  We will obtain a dermatology consult.  IV leucovorin will be started, and the patient will be put on high-dose corticosteroids.

Giant Left MCA Aneurysm.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nHX: This 46y/o RHM with HTN was well until 2 weeks prior to exam when he experienced sudden onset dizziness and RUE clumsiness. The symptoms resolved within 10 min. He did well until the afternoon of admission when while moving the lawn he experienced lightheadedness, RUE dysfunction and expressive aphasia (could not get the words out). His wife took him to his local MD, and on the way there his symptoms resolved. His aphasia recurred at his physician's office and a CT scan of the brain revealed a left temporal mass. He was transferred to UIHC.\n\nPMH: HTN for many years\n\nMEDS: Vasotec and Dyazide\n\nSHX/FHX: ETOH abuse (quit '92), 30pk-yr Cigarettes (quit '92)\n\nEXAM: BP158/92, HR91, RR16\n\nMS: Speech fluent without dysarthria\n\nCN: no deficits noted\n\nMotor: no weakness or abnormal tone noted\n\nSensory: no deficits noted\n\nCoord: normal\n\nStation: no drift\n\nGait ND\n\nReflexes: 3+ throughout.

It has a peripheral dark rim on T1 and T2 with surrounding edema. This suggests a component of methemoglobin and hemosiderin within it. Slight peripheral enhancement was identified. There are two smaller foci of enhancement in the posterior parietal lobe on the right. There is nonspecific white matter foci within the pons and right thalamus. Impression: right temporoparietal hemorrhage, suggesting aneurysm or mass. The two smaller foci may suggest metastasis. The white matter changes probably reflect microvascular disease.\n\n3 Vessel cerebroangiogram, 8/31/92: Lobulated fusiform aneurysm off a peripheral branch of the left middle cerebral artery with slow flow into the vessel distal to the aneurysm.\n\nCOURSE: The aneurysm was felt to be inoperable and he was discharged home on Dilantin, ASA, and Diltiazem.

He was transported directly from the scene, approximately one mile east of UIHC. The patient developed labored breathing and an EMT attempted to intubate the patient in the UIHC ER garage, but upon evaluation in the ER, was found to be in his esophagus and was immediately replaced into the trachea. Replacement of the ET tube required succinylcholine. The patient remained in a C-collar during the procedure. Once in the ER the patient had a 15min period of bradycardia.\n\nMEDS: none prior to accident.\n\nPMH: No significant chronic or recent illness. s/p left knee arthroplasty. h/o hand fractures.\n\nFHX: Unremarkable.\n\nSHX: Married. Rare cigarette use/Occasional Marijuana use/Social ETOH use per wife.\n\nEXAM: BP156/79. HR 74 RR (Ambu Bag ventilation via ET tube) 34.7C 72-100% O2Sat.\n\nMS: Unresponsive to verbal stimulation.

Babinski signs were present bilaterally.\n\nHEENT: severe facial injury with brain parenchyma and blood from the right nostril. Severe soft tissue swelling about side of head.\n\nGen Exam: CV: RRR without murmur. Lungs: CTA. Abdomen: distended after ET tube misplacement.\n\nCOURSE: HCT upon arrival, 10/29/92, revealed: Extensive parenchymal contusions in right fronto-parietal area. Pronounced diffuse brain swelling seemingly obliterates the mesencephalic cistern and 4th ventricle. Considerable mass effect is exerted upon the right lateral ventricle, near totally obliterating its contour. Massive subcutaneous soft tissue swelling is present along the right anterolateral parietal area. There are extensive fractures of the following: two component horizontal fractures throughout the floor of the right middle cranial fossa which includes the squamous and petrous portions of the temporal bone, as well as the greater wing of the sphenoid. Comminuted fractures of the aqueous portion of the temporal bone and parietal bone is noted on the right. Extensive comminution of the right half of the frontal bone and marked displacement is seen. Comminuted fractures of the medial wall of the right orbit and ethmoidal air cells is seen with near total opacification of the air cells. The medial and lateral walls of the maxillary sinus are fractured and minimally displaced, as well as the medial wall of the left maxillary sinus. The right zygomatic bone is fractured at its articulation with the sphenoid bone and displaced posteriorly.\n\nPortable chest, c-spine and abdominal XRays were unremarkable, but limited studies. Abdominal CT was unremarkable.\n\nHgb 10.4g/dl, Hct29%, WBC17.4k/mm3, Plt 190K. ABG:7.28/48/46 on admission. Glucose 131.\n\nThe patient was hyperventilated, Mannitol was administered (1g/kg), and the patient was given a Dilantin loading dose. He was taken to surgery immediately following the above studies to decompress the contused brain and remove bony fragments from multiple skull fractures. The patient remained in a persistent vegetative state at UIHC, and upon the request of this wife his feeding tube was discontinued. He later expired.

There had been no known toxic intrauterine exposures. He had no serious illnesses or hospitalizations since birth. He sat independently at 7 months, stood at 11 months, crawled at 16 months, but did not cruise until 18 months.\n\nHe currently cannot walk and easily falls. His gait is reportedly marked by left &quot;intoeing.&quot; His upper extremity strength and coordination reportedly appear quite normal and he is able to feed himself, throw and transfer objects easily. He knows greater than 20 words and speaks two-word phrases.\n\nNo seizures or unusual behavior were reported except for &quot;quivering&quot; movement of his jaw. This has occurred since birth. In addition the parents have noted transient left exotropia.\n\nPMH: As above.\n\nFHX: Many family members with &quot;lazy eye.&quot; No other neurologic diseases declared.\n\n9 and 5 year old sisters who are healthy.\n\nSHX: lives with parents and sisters.\n\nEXAM: BP83/67 HR122 36.4C Head circumference 48.0cm Weight 12.68kg (70%) Height 86.0cm (70%)\n\nMS: fairly cooperative.\n\nCN: Minimal transient esotropia OS.

Both lower extremities could rotate outward to 90degrees. There was marked passive eversion at the ankles as well.\n\nReflexes: 2+/2+ throughout.\n\nMusculoskeletal: pes planovalgus bilaterally.\n\nCOURSE: CK normal. The parents decided to forego an MRI in 8/90. The patient returned 12/11/92 at age 4 years. He was ambulatory and able to run awkwardly. His general health had been good, but he showed signs developmental delay. Formal evaluation had tested his IQ at 87 at age 3.5 years. He was weakest on tasks requiring visual/motor integration and fine motor and visual discrimination skills. He was 6 months delayed in cognitive development at that time. On exam, age 4 years, he displayed mild right ankle laxity on eversion and inversion, but normal gait. The rest of the neurological exam was normal. Head circumference was 49.5cm (50%) and height and weight were in the 90th percentile. Fragile X analysis and karyotyping were unremarkable.

MRI Brain/orbit/neck with gadolinium, 10/20/95, revealed abnormal enhancing signal in the right cavernous sinus and sinus mucosal thickening in both maxillary sinuses/ethmoid sinuses/frontal sinuses. CXR, 10/20/95, showed a lobulated mass arising from the right hilum. The mass appeared to obstruct the right middle lobe, causing partial collapse of this lobe. Chest CT with contrast, 10/23/95, revealed a 3.2x4.5x4.0cm mass in the right hilar region with impingement on the right lower bronchus. There appeared to be calcification as well as low attenuation regions within the mass. No lymphadenopathy was noted. She underwent bronchoscopy with bronchial brushing and transbronchial aspirate of the right lung on 10/24/95: no tumor cells were identified, GMS stains were negative and there was no evidence of viral changes, fungus or PCP by culture or molecular assay.

In January 2002, plain pelvic films showed no fracture or dislocation of the hips. Elbow films also showed no acute injury, but there were some erosions along the posterior aspect of the olecranon. An MRI was performed of his lumbar spine which showed degenerative disk disease, spondylosis, and annular bulging/herniation at L4-L5 with resultant encroachment on the neural foramen. He was evaluated by neurosurgery, who felt he should not have surgery at this time. His pain continued and progressively worsened, becoming unresponsive to medical therapy including narcotics\n\nIn May 2002, as part of a vascular work-up for the patient s non-healing right toe, an MRA showed extensive vascular disease in the vessels of both legs below the knees and evidence of bilateral trochanteric bursitis.

Denies chest pain, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, recent change in baseline bowel movements, or dysuria. Denies any bleeding. Several year history of erectile dysfunction.\n\nPhysical Exam: BP - 124/70, HR - 72, RR - 14, T - 97.8\n\nGen: Well nourished, pleasant male in no acute distress.\n\nHEENT: Extra-ocular muscles intact. Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. Oropharynx clear. No funduscopic exam recorded.\n\nNeck: Supple. No thyromegaly, bruits, or elevation of jugular venous pressure.\n\nLungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\n\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm. 1/6 systolic ejection murmur at left sternal border. No gallops, rubs, or clicks. Normal pulses.\n\nAbd: Soft and non-distended. Non-tender. Normoactive bowel sounds in all four quadrants. Midline surgical scar. Kidney palpable in left lower quadrant. No hepatosplenomegaly and no masses.\n\nExts: No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.

Strength 5/5.\n\nSTUDIES:\n\n1/02 MRI Lumbar spine without contrast:\n\n1. Spondylosis at L2-3 with marked narrowing of the disk space, grade I/IV degenerative retrolisthesis, and moderately severe central spinal canal and bilateral foraminal stenosis.\n\n2. Degenerative disk disease at L4-5 with diffuse annular bulging and a broad based right lateral foraminal and extra-foraminal far lateral herniation which results in significant encroachment on the right lateral recess and neural foramen, and this deserves clinical correlation for right L4 and L5 radiculopathy. Degenerative facet joint changes and ligamentum flavum thickening are noted bilaterally at this level, but the central canal is adequate.\n\n3. Spondylosis with annular bulging and facet joint degenerative disease at L5-S1, L3-L4, and L1-L2 to a mild degree without significant stenosis.\n\n4. Note is made of probable cyst of the upper pole of the right kidney which measures 1.8cm in diameter. There is decrease in size of the right kidney which may be due to chronic renal disease.\n\n1/02 Left Elbow Films (2 views):\n\nRather extensive vascular calcification in the soft tissues. There is no evidence of an acute injury. There is, however, what appears to be some erosion along the posterior aspect of the olecranon.\n\n1/02 Pelvis films:\n\nThere is no fracture or dislocation of the hip identified. Extensive vascular calcification noted.\n\n5/02 MRA Lower Extremity with and without contrast:\n\n1. Minimal atherosclerotic narrowing of the bilateral superficial femoral arteries. Severe atherosclerotic disease of bilateral popliteal, anterior tibial, peroneal, and posterior tibial arteries (right greater than left).\n\n2. Abnormal enhancing lesion in the left proximal femur, the left iliac bone, and the right iliac bone. There may be a similar lesion in the right tibia.\n\n3. Abnormal enhancement in the trochanteric bursa of both femurs consistent with bursitis.\n\n4. The vertebral bodies demonstrate abnormal enhancement adjacent to the end-plates likely due to degenerative disk disease. There are questionable abnormal enhancing lesions in the vertebral bodies.\n\n6/02 Chest X-ray\n\nThere are no compression fractures identified. The lungs are adequately expanded. Two densities in right hemithorax that appear to represent healing rib fractures. The one involving the right 7th rib posteriorly could be a pathologic fracture. No lung nodules or lymphadenopathy.\n\n6/02 Whole Body Bone Scan:\n\nAreas of increased tracer activity are noted in the right proximal humerus, the left scapula at the region of the glenoid, the anterior aspect of the right third rib, the posterior aspect of the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth ribs, the left lateral aspect of the T10 vertebra, the L3 vertebra, the right lateral aspect of the L5 vertebra, the left iliac crest, both SI joints, the right ischial bone, the left proximal and mid femur, the right distal femur and the left proximal tibia.\n\nIrregular tracer activity is noted in the cervical and thoracic spine consistent with degenerative changes.\n\nTracer in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen consistent with a kidney transplant.\n\nA diagnostic procedure was performed as an outpatient on 7/10/02.

She has suffered from obesity for a while.  She has made attempts at nonsurgical weight loss and has not been successful.  She does have a history of pulmonary embolus and a right lower lobe lobectomy.  She is currently doing a lean and green diet and trying to cut out her bad carb intake.  She did mention having some issues with fruits that did upset her stomach.  Last visit, we had talked about her exercising.  She has Gazelle, I believe, and she was going out with her husband bring it up for her to utilize.  Apparently, she made space for it, but it has not been bought up, so she is still planning on getting that exercising machine.  She is planning to start the patches to quit smoking, and she is going to be starting the Medifast in the next couple of weeks.  She did not feel quite well today.  She has a lot going on with her kids starting back at schools, so she is feeling a bit stressed.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her temperature is 97.6, her pulse is 72, weight is 309.4 pounds, her blood pressure is 142/94.  She has a headache.  BMI is 45.5.  She has lost 5.6 pounds since her last visit.  She is alert and oriented, in no apparent distress.\n\nASSESSMENT/PLAN:  Patient with morbid obesity.  She has a history of pulmonary embolus and right lower lobe lobectomy.  She is scheduled for a gastric bypass in 03/10 and a temporary IVC filter for pulmonary embolus.  She is doing the lean and green.  I encouraged her to continue to work with it and try to continue to cut out eating breads and things such as cookies.  May be with the holidays over that will be a bit easier.  I would like her to see the pulmonologist given that she has a history of right lower lobe lobectomy.  She is scheduled to get an ABG and pulmonary function tests recently, but had to reschedule for those in 02/10.  We did again review the plan for surgery.  She will need to do, at least continue to work on losing weight, the closer we can get to 10% the better.  I will see her again next month as we get closer to her surgery date.

A physician/patient relationship was not established, there was no limit to confidentiality, nor was treatment rendered or advised.  This was explained to the patient, he appeared to understand, and agreed to continue.\n\nIDENTIFYING DATA:  Mr. T is a 45-year-old white male.\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mr. T presented with significant muscle tremor, constant headaches, excessive nervousness, poor concentration, and poor ability to focus.  His confidence and self-esteem are significantly low.  He stated he has excessive somnolence, his energy level is extremely low, motivation is low, and he has a lack for personal interests.  He has had suicidal ideation, but this is currently in remission.  Furthermore, he continues to have hopeless thoughts and crying spells.  Mr. T stated these symptoms appeared approximately two months ago.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  On March 25, 2003, Mr. T was fired from his job secondary, to an event at which he stated he was first being harassed by another employee.&quot; This other, employee had confronted Mr. T with a very aggressive, verbal style, where this employee had placed his face directly in front of Mr. T was spitting on him, and called him &quot;bitch.&quot; Mr. T then retaliated, and went to hit the other employee.  Due to this event, Mr. T was fired.  It should be noted that Mr. T stated he had been harassed by this individual for over a year and had reported the harassment to his boss and was told to &quot;deal with it.&quot;\n\nThere are no other apparent stressors in Mr. T's life at this time or in recent months.  Mr. T stated that work was his entire life and he based his entire identity on his work ethic.  It should be noted that Mr. T was a process engineer for Plum Industries for the past 14 years.\n\nPAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:  There is no evidence of any psychiatric hospitalizations or psychiatric interventions other than a recent visit to Mr. T's family physician, Dr. B at which point Mr. T was placed on Lexapro with an unknown dose at this time.  Mr. T is currently seeing Dr. J for psychotherapy where he has been in treatment since April, 2003.\n\nPAST PSYCHIATRIC REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Mr. T denied any history throughout his childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood for depressive, anxiety, or psychotic disorders.  He denied any suicide attempts, or profound suicidal or homicidal ideation.  Mr. T furthermore stated that his family psychiatric history is unremarkable.\n\nSUBSTANCE ABUSE HISTORY:  Mr. T stated he used alcohol following his divorce in 1993, but has not used it for the last two years.  No other substance abuse was noted.\n\nLEGAL HISTORY:  Currently, charges are pending over the above described incident.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY:  Mr. T denied any hospitalizations, surgeries, or current medications use for any heart disease, lung disease, liver disease, kidney disease, gastrointestinal disease, neurological disease, closed head injury, endocrine disease, infectious, blood or muscles disease other than stating he has a hiatal hernia and hypercholesterolemia.\n\nPERSONAL AND SOCIAL HISTORY:  Mr. T was born in Dwyne, Missouri, with no complications associated with his birth.  Originally, he was raised by both parents, but they separated at an early age.  When he was about seven years old, he was raised by his mother and stepfather.  He did not sustain a relationship with his biological father from that time on.  He stated his parents moved a lot, and because this many times he was picked on in his new environments, Mr. T stated he was, at times, a rebellious teenager, but he denied any significant inability to socialize, and denied any learning disabilities or the need for special education.\n\nMr. T stated his stepfather was somewhat verbally abusive, and that he committed suicide when Mr. T was 18 years old.  He graduated from high school and began work at Dana Corporation for two to three years, after which he worked as an energy, auditor for a gas company.  He then became a homemaker while his wife worked for Chrysler for approximately two years.  Mr. T was married for eleven years, and divorced in 1993.  He has a son who is currently 20 years old.  After being a home maker, Mr. T worked for his mother in a restaurant, and moved on from there to work for Borg-Warner corporation for one to two years before beginning at Plum Industries, where he worked for 14 years and worked his way up to lead engineer.\n\nMental Status Exam:  Mr. T presented with a hyper vigilant appearance, his eye contact was appropriate to the interview, and his motor behavior was tense.  At times he showed some involuntary movements that would be more akin to a resting tremor.  There was no psychomotor retardation, but there was some mild psychomotor excitement.  His speech was clear, concise, but pressured.  His attitude was overly negative and his mood was significant for moderate depression, anxiety, anhedonia and loneliness, and mild evidence of anger.  There was no evidence of euphoria or diurnal mood variation.  His affective expression was restricted range, but there was no evidence of lability.  At times, his affective tone and facial expressions were inappropriate to the interview.  There was no evidence of auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, tactile or visceral hallucinations.  There was no evidence of illusions, depersonalizations, or derealizations.  Mr. T presented with a sequential and goal directed stream of thought.  There was no evidence of incoherence, irrelevance, evasiveness, circumstantiality, loose associations, or concrete thinking.  There was no evidence of delusions; however, there was some ambivalence, guilt, and self-derogatory thoughts.  There was evidence of concreteness for similarities and proverbs.  His intelligence was average.  His concentration was mildly impaired, and there was no evidence of distractibility.  He was oriented to time, place, person and situation.  There was no evidence of clouded consciousness or dissociation.  His memory was intact for immediate, recent, and remote events.\n\nHe presented with poor appetite, easily fatigued, and decreased libidinal drive, as well as excessive somnolence.  There was a moderate preoccupation with his physical health pertaining to his headaches.  His judgment was poor for finances, family relations, social relations, employment, and, at this time, he had no future plans.  Mr. T's insight is somewhat moderate as he is aware of his contribution to the problem.  His motivation for getting well is good as he accepts offered treatment, complies with recommended treatment, and seeks effective treatments.  He has a well-developed empathy for others and capacity for affection.\n\nThere was no evidence of entitlement, egocentricity, controllingness, intimidation, or manipulation.  His credibility seemed good.  There was no evidence for potential self-injury, suicide, or violence.  The reliability and completeness of information was very good, and there were no barriers to communication.  The information gathered was based on the patient's self-report and objective testing and observation.  His attitude toward the examiner was neutral and his attitude toward the examination process was neutral.  There was no evidence for indices of malingering as there was no marked discrepancy between claimed impairment and objective findings, and there was no lack of cooperation with the evaluation or poor compliance with treatment, and no evidence of antisocial personality disorder.\n\nIMPRESSIONS:  Major Depressive Disorder, single episode\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS AND PLAN:  I recommend Mr. T continue with psychopharmacologic care as well as psychotherapy.  At this time, the excessive amount of psychiatric symptoms would impede Mr. T from seeking employment.  Furthermore, it appears that the primary precipitating event had occurred on March 25, 2003, when Mr. T was fired from his job after being harassed for over a year.  As Mr. T placed his entire identity and sense of survival on his work, this was a deafening blow to his psychological functioning.  Furthermore, it only appears logical that this would precipitate a major depressive episode.

There is an x-ray of the pelvis, which shows normal pelvis and right hip.  There is also a CT scan of the cervical spine that shows no evidence of acute traumatic bony injury of the cervical spine.  There is some prevertibral soft tissue swelling from C5 through C7.  This is nonspecific and could be due to prominence of upper esophageal sphincter.  The CT scan of the brain without contrast shows no evidence of acute intracranial injury.  There is some mucus in the left sphenoid sinus.  The patient also has emergent CT scan without contrast of the abdomen.  The initial studies show some dependent atelectasis in both lungs.

Her pain is controlled with medication and she is feeling more comfortable and removed from the backboard.  The patient's CT scans of the abdomen appeared normal.  She has no signs of bleeding.  I believe, she has just a contusion and abrasion to her abdomen from the seatbelt and likely from the airbag as well.  The patient is able to stand and walk through the emergency department without difficulty.  She has no abrasions or lacerations.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Multiple contusions and abdominal pain, status post motor vehicle collision.  Plan is the patient does not appear to have any intraabdominal or pelvic abnormities following her CT scans.  She has normal scans of the brain and her C-spine as well.  The patient is in stable condition.  She will be discharged with instructions to return to the emergency department if her pain increases or if she has increasing abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting.  The patient is given a prescription for Vicodin and Flexeril to use it at home for her muscular pain.

This patient also has positive smoking exposure coming from mom.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Paternal grandmother has diabetes and hypertension, paternal grandfather has emphysema and was a smoker.  There are no children needing the use of a pediatric subspecialist or any childhood deaths less than 1 year of age.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  \nVITALS:  Temperature max is 99, heart rate was 133 to 177, blood pressure is 114/43 (while moving), respiratory rate was 28 to 56 with O2 saturations 97 to 100% on room air.  Weight was 4.1 kg.\nGENERAL:  Not in acute distress, sneezing, positive congestion with breaths taken.\nHEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic head.  Anterior fontanelle was soft, open, and flat.  Bilateral red reflexes were positive.  Oropharynx is clear with palate intact, negative rhinorrhea.\nCARDIOVASCULAR:  Heart was regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the upper left sternal border, vibratory in nature.  Capillary refill was less than 3 seconds.\nLUNGS:  Positive upper airway congestion, transmitted sounds; negative retractions, nasal flaring, or wheezes.\nABDOMEN:  Bowel sounds are positive, nontender, soft, negative hepatosplenomegaly.  Umbilical site was with scant dried yellow discharge.\nGU:  Tanner stage 1 male, circumcised.

A Gram stain showed rare white blood cells, many red blood cells, no organisms.\n\nASSESSMENT:  A 21-day-old with:\n1.  Rule out sepsis.\n2.  Possible upper respiratory infection.\n\nGiven the patient's multiple sick contacts, he is possibly with a viral upper respiratory infection causing his upper airway congestion plus probable fever.  The bacterial considerations although to consider in this child include group B streptococcus, E. coli, and Listeria.  We should also consider herpes simplex virus, although these 3200 red blood cells from his CSF could be due to his bloody tap in the ER.  Also, there is not a predominant lymphocytosis of his CSF sample (there is 0 white blood cell count in the cell count).\n\nAlso to consider in this child is RSV.  The patient though has more congested, nasal breathing more than respiratory distress, for example retractions, desaturations, or accessory muscle use.  Also, there is negative apnea in this patient.\n\nPLAN:  \n1.  We will place this patient on the rule out sepsis pathway including IV antibiotics, ampicillin and gentamicin for at least 48 hours.\n2.  We will follow up with his blood, urine, and CSF cultures.\n3.  I called the lab for the addition of a possible HSV PCR to add to his CSF sample, but there is currently not enough left for this admin.  We will not currently start acyclovir considering his bloody tap, but we will pass this information on to the day team for the possible start of this antibiotic.\n4.  We will place this patient on IV fluids and wean as his p.o. intake increases.\n5.  We will try to supply lanolin cream or cocoa butter for mom's comfort.\n6.  We will keep the patient's umbilicus and penis status post circumcision clean with a wet cloth.\n7.  We educated mom about the risks of smoking plus the increased incidence of sudden infant death syndrome with children, who are exposed to smoke.\n8.  These initial plans were all discussed with mom and dad at the bedside.

Mom denies any apnea, perioral cyanosis, or color changes.  These movements are without any back arching.  They mainly occur during sleep, so mom is unaware of any eye rolling.  Mom is able to wake the patient up during this periods and stop the patient's extremity movements.\n\nOtherwise, this patient has been active, breast-feeding well, although she falls asleep at the breast.  She is currently taking in 15 to 20 minutes of breast milk every 2 to 3 hours.  She is having increased diapers up to 8 wet and 6 to 7 dirty-yellow stools per day.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative fever, negative fussiness, tracks with her eyes, some sneezing and hiccups.

There are no other children in the family who see a specialist or no child death less than 1 year of age.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   \nVITAL SIGNS:  Temperature was 97.5, heart rate was 150, blood pressure was 88/53, respiratory rate was 37 on room air.  Weight was 4 kg, this placed her at the 75th to 90th percentile; the length was 52 cm, this places her at the 75th to 90th percentile, and head circumference was 36 cm, which places her at the 75th percentile.\nGENERAL:  In no acute distress, alert, nonfussy, active, breast-feeding well.\nHEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic head.  Negative for any cephalohematomas.  The anterior fontanelle was soft, open, and flat.  Bilateral red reflexes were positive.  The extraocular muscles were intact.  The tympanic membranes were clear.  Negative rhinorrhea.  The oropharynx is clear with intact hard and soft palates.  There was an Epstein pearl approximately 1 to 2 o'clock on the upper palate.\nNECK:  Negative for swelling or clavicular crepitus.\nCARDIOVASCULAR:  Heart was regular rate and rhythm without any murmurs.  Femoral pulses were positive.  Capillary refill was less than 2 seconds.\nLUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally without any increased work of breathing.

A CRP was less than 0.3.  CMP showed a sodium of 136, potassium of 5.3, chloride of 106, bicarbonate of 23, BUN of 5, creatinine of 0.4, glucose of 93, calcium was 11.1.  T and direct bilirubin were 8.4 and 0.  Liver function tests include an AST of 50, an ALT of 10, and an alkaline phosphatase of 173.\n\nA urinalysis was negative only showing 0 to 5 epithelial cells and trace crystals.\n\nCurrent pending studies include CSF studies such as a Gram stain, culture, glucose, protein, cell count, and HSV PCR.  Also, pending include a head CT and a blood and urine culture.\n\nASSESSMENT:  A 10-day-old neonate with:\n1.  Seizure-like activity.\n2.  Physiologic jaundice of the newborn.\n\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES:  In this patient includes:\n1.  Infantile spasms.\n2.  Benign neonatal sleep myoclonus - this patient's movements occur during sleep and consist of extremity jerking.  Also compatible with this diagnosis includes the fact that mom is able to stop these movements.\n3.  Hyperekplexia - this patient though is without any startle movements or stiffness.\n4.  Trauma - possibilities include any type of intracranial hemorrhage, subdural or epidural.  This patient though is without any rapidly declining neurologic deficits currently.\n5.  Neonatal hypoxemia - there is no history of hypoxemic events at birth.\n6.  Central nervous system infection or bacteremia - possibilities include bacterial meningitis.  The most likely bacteria include group B streptococcus, Escherichia coli, and Listeria.  Also to consider include herpes simplex virus encephalitis or urosepsis.  This patient though is with a normal urinalysis currently, normal CBC without fever or lethargy in her history and not toxic appearing currently.\n7.  Metabolic causes causing seizures including hypocalcemia and hypoglycemia - this patient is with a normal complete metabolic panel.\n8.  Congenital brain abnormality - so far this patient is with a normal neuro and developmental exam.\n9.  Drug withdrawal or intoxication - this could always be a possibility, but the patient's parents are seemingly good parents with a good social history not raising any flags for abuse.\n\nPLAN:\n1.  Currently this patient has pending CSF studies including a culture plus blood and urine culture.  Also, pending right now is an HSV PCR.  In the meantime, we will start antibiotics including ampicillin, gentamicin, and acyclovir to cover for the most likely bacterial and viral pathogens, especially herpes virus.\n2.  We will obtain a head CT tonight to rule out any trauma or bleeds in brain.\n3.  We will place this patient on continuous cardiorespiratory and pulse oximetry monitoring and document vitals during any seizure-like activity.\n4.  We will obtain an EEG in the morning in addition to a neurology consult.\n5.  We will continue to monitor this patient's jaundice, which has decreased since her discharge from the hospital.\n6.  These initial plans were all discussed with mom at the bedside, including the risks and benefits of a lumbar puncture, which has already been performed.

The patient was found to have a left ureteral stone measuring about 1.3 cm in size per the patient's history.  The patient has had pain in the abdomen and across the back for the last four to five days.  The patient has some nausea and vomiting.  The patient wants something done for the stone.  The patient denies any hematuria, dysuria, burning or pain.  The patient denies any fevers.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Negative.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Years ago she had surgery that she does not recall.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  None.\n\nALLERGIES:  None.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Denies any seizure disorder, chest pain, denies any shortness of breath, denies any dysuria, burning or pain, denies any nausea or vomiting at this time.  The patient does have a history of nausea and vomiting, but is doing better.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nVITAL SIGNS:  The patient is afebrile.  Vitals are stable.\nHEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.\nABDOMEN:  Soft, left-sided flank pain and left lower abdominal pain.\n\nThe rest of the exam is benign.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  White count of 7.8, hemoglobin 13.8, and platelets 234,000.  The patient's creatinine is 0.92.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n1.  Left flank pain.\n2.  Left ureteral stone.\n3.  Nausea and vomiting.\n\nPLAN:  Plan for laser lithotripsy tomorrow.  Options such as watchful waiting, laser lithotripsy, and shockwave lithotripsy were discussed.  The patient has a pretty enlarged stone.  Failure of the procedure if the stone is significantly impacted into the ureteral wall was discussed.  The patient understood that the success of the surgery may be or may not be 100%, that she may require shockwave lithotripsy if we are unable to get the entire stone out in one sitting.  The patient understood all the risk, benefits of the procedure and wanted to proceed.  Need for stent was also discussed with the patient.  The patient will be scheduled for surgery tomorrow.  Plan for continuation of the antibiotics, obtain urinalysis and culture, and plan for KUB to evaluate for the exact location of the stone prior to surgery tomorrow.

Pain in joint pelvic region/thigh.\n18.  Motor vehicle traffic accident, not otherwise specified.\n\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURES:  None.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  As per Dr. X without any changes or corrections.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 50-year-old male, who is initially transferred from Medical Center after treatment for multiple fractures after a motor vehicle accident.  He had a left tibial plateau fracture, right forearm fracture with ORIF, head laceration, and initially some symptoms of head injury.  When he was initially transferred to HealthSouth, he was status post ORIF for his right forearm.  He had a brace placed in the left leg for his left tibial plateau fracture.  He was confused initially and initially started on rehab.  He was diagnosed with some acute psychosis and thought problems likely related to his alcohol abuse history.  He did well from orthopedic standpoint.  He did have a small sacral decubitus ulcer, which was well controlled with the wound care team and healed quite nicely.  He did have some anemia initially and he had dropped down in to the low 9, but he was 9.2 with his lowest on 06/11/2008, which had responded well to iron treatment and by the time of discharge, he was lower at 11.0.  He made slow progress from therapy.  His confusion gradually cleared.  He did have some problems with insomnia and was placed on Seroquel to help with both of his moods and other issues and he did quite well with this.  He did require some Ativan for agitation.  He was on chronic pain medications as an outpatient.  His medications were adjusted here and he did well with this as well.  The patient was followed throughout his entire stay with case management and discussions were made with them and the psychologist concerning the placement upon discharge to an acute alcohol rehab facility; however, the patient refused throughout this entire stay.  We did have orthopedic followup.  He was taken out of his right leg brace the week of 06/16/2008.  He did well with therapy.  Overall, he was doing much and much better.  He had progressed with the therapy to the point where that he was comfortable to go home and receive outpatient therapy and follow up with his primary care physician.  On 06/20/2008, with all parties in agreement, the patient was discharged to home in stable condition.\n\nAt the time of discharge, the patient's ambulatory status was much better.  He was using a wheeled walker.  He was able to bear weight on his left leg.  His pain level had been well controlled and his moods had improved dramatically.  He was no longer having any signs of agitation or confusion and he seemed to be at a stable baseline.  His anemia had resolved almost completely and he was doing quite well. \n\nMEDICATIONS:  On discharge included:\n1.  Calcium with vitamin D 1 tablet twice a day.\n2.  Ferrous sulfate 325 mg t.i.d.\n3.  Multivitamin 1 daily.\n4.  He was on nicotine patch 21 mg per 24 hour.\n5.  He was on Seroquel 25 mg at bedtime.\n6.  He was on Xenaderm for his sacral pressure ulcer.\n7.  He was on Vicodin p.r.n. for pain.\n8.  Ativan 1 mg b.i.d. for anxiety and otherwise he is doing quite well.\n\nThe patient was told to follow up with his orthopedist Dr. Y and also with his primary care physician upon discharge.

He was doing fairly well until last week while mowing the lawn, he injured his right foot.  He presented to the Hospital Emergency Room.  Cultures taken from the wound on 06/25/2008, were reported positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).  The patient was started on intravenous antibiotic therapy with Levaquin and later on that was changed to oral formulation.  The patient underwent debridement of the wound on 07/29/2008.  Apparently, MRI and a bone scan was performed at that facility, which was reported negative for osteomyelitis.  The patient was then referred to the wound care center at General Hospital.  From there, he has been admitted to Long-Term Acute Care Facility for wound care with wound VAC placement.  On exam, he has a lacerated wound on the plantar aspect of the right foot, which extends from the second metatarsal area to the fifth metatarsal area, closed with the area of the head of these bones.  The wound itself is deep and stage IV and with exam of her gloved finger in my opinion, the third metatarsal bone is palpable, which leads to the clinical diagnosis of osteomyelitis.  The patient has serosanguineous drainage in this wound and it tracks under the skin in all directions except distal.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Positive for:\n1.  Diabetes mellitus.\n2.  Osteomyelitis of the right fifth toe, which was treated with intravenous antibiotic therapy for 6 weeks about 5 years back.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for mother passing away in her late 60s from heart attack, father had liver cancer, and passed away from that.  One of his children suffers from hypothyroidism, 2 grandchildren has cerebral palsy secondary to being prematurely born.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive findings of the foot that have been mentioned above.  All other systems reviewed were negative.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nGeneral:  A 68-year-old Caucasian male who was not in any acute hemodynamic distress at present.\nVital Signs:  Show a maximum recorded temperature of 98, pulse is rating between 67 to 80 per minute, respiratory rate is 20 per minute, blood pressure is varying between 137/63 to 169/75.\nHEENT:  Pupils equal, round, reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Head is normocephalic.  External ear exam is normal.\nNeck:  Supple.  There is no palpable lymphadenopathy.\nCardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm of the heart without any appreciable murmur, rub or gallop.\nLungs:  Clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally.\nAbdomen:  Soft, nontender, and nondistended without any organomegaly and bowel sounds are positive.  There is no palpable lymphadenopathy in the inguinal and femoral area.\nExtremities:  There is no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  There is no peripheral stigmata of endocarditis.  On the plantar aspect of the distal part of the right foot, the patient has a lacerated wound, which extends from the second metatarsal area to the fifth metatarsal area.  Tracking under the skin is palpable with a gloved finger in all direction except the distal one.  On the proximal tracking, the area of the wound, the third metatarsal bone is palpable.  Therefore, clinically, the patient has diagnoses of osteomyelitis.\nCentral nervous system:  The patient is alert, oriented x3.  Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.  There is no focal deficit appreciated.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  No laboratory or radiological data is available at present in the chart.\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN:  A 68-year-old Caucasian male with history of diabetes mellitus who had an accidental lawn mower-associated injury on the right foot.  He has undergone debridement on 07/29/2008.  Culture results from the debridement procedure are not available.  Wound cultures from 07/25/2008 showed methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.\n\nFrom the Infectious Disease point of view, the patient has the following problems, and I would recommend following treatments strategy.\n\n1.  Right foot infected ulcer with clinical evidence of osteomyelitis.  Even if the MRI and bone scan are negative, the treatment should be guided with diagnosis on clinical counts in my opinion.  Cultures have been reported positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.  Therefore, I would discontinue the current antibiotic regimen of oral Levaquin, Zyvox, and intravenous Zosyn, and start the patient on intravenous Ancef 2 g q.8 h.  We will need to continue this treatment for 6 weeks for treatment of osteomyelitis and deep wound infection.  I would also recommend continuation of wound care and wound VAC placement that would start tomorrow.  We will get a PICC line placed to complete the 6-week course of intravenous antibiotic therapy.\n2.  We would check labs including CBC with differential, chemistry 7 panel, LFTs, ESR, and C-reactive protein levels every Monday and chemistry 7 panel and CBC every Thursday for the duration of antibiotic therapy.\n3.  I will continue to monitor wound healing 2 to 3 times a week.  Wound care will be managed by the wound care team at the Long-Term Acute Care Facility.\n4.  The treatment plan was discussed in detail with the patient and his daughter who was visiting him when I saw him.\n5.  Other medical problems will continue to be followed and treated by Dr. X's group during this hospitalization.\n6.  I appreciate the opportunity of participating in this patient's care.  If you have any questions please feel free to call me at any time.  I will continue to follow the patient along with you for the next few days during this hospitalization.  We would also try to get the results of the deep wound cultures from 07/29/2008, MRI, and bone scan from Hospital.

He has not taken anything today for his symptoms, but he is on hydrochlorothiazide and metoprolol for hypertension as well as a baby aspirin each day.\n\nALLERGIES:  HE DOES HAVE MEDICATION INTOLERANCES TO SULFA DRUGS (HEADACHE), MORPHINE (NAUSEA AND VOMITING), AND TORADOL (ULCER).\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is married and is a nonsmoker and lives with his wife, who is here with him.\n\nNursing notes were reviewed with which I agree.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\nVITAL SIGNS:  Temp and vital signs are all within normal limits.\nGENERAL:  In general, the patient is an elderly white male who is sitting on the stretcher in no acute distress.\nHEENT:  Head is normocephalic and atraumatic.  The face shows no edema.  The tongue is not swollen and the airway is widely patent.\nNECK:  No stridor.\nHEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.\nLUNGS:  Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.\nEXTREMITIES:  Upper extremities, there is some edema and erythema to the dorsum of the left hand in the region of the distal third to fifth metacarpals.  There was some slight edema of the fourth digit, on which he still is wearing his wedding band.  The right hand shows no reaction.  The right knee is not swollen either.\n\nThe left fourth digit was wrapped in a rubber tourniquet to express the edema and using some Surgilube, I was able to remove his wedding band without any difficulty.  Patient was given Claritin 10 mg orally for what appears to be a simple local reaction to an insect sting.  I did explain to him that his swelling and redness may progress over the next few days.\n\nASSESSMENT:  Local reaction secondary to insect sting.\n\nPLAN:  The patient was reassured that this is not a serious reaction to an insect sting and he should not progress to such a reaction.  I did urge him to use Claritin 10 mg once daily until the redness and swelling has gone.  I did explain that the swelling may worsen over the next two to three days, it may produce a large local reaction, but that anti-histamines were still the mainstay of therapy for such a reaction.  If he is not improved in the next four days, follow up with his PCP for a re-exam.

Acute on chronic COPD exacerbation.\n2.  Community acquired pneumonia both resolving.  However, she may need home O2 for a short period of time.\n3.  Generalized weakness and deconditioning secondary to the above.  Also sustained a fall secondary to instability and not using her walker or calling for assistance.  The patient stated that she knew better and she should have called for assistance and she had been told repeatedly from her family members and staff to call for assistance if she needed to get out of bed.\n\nPLAN:\n1.  I will have PT and OT evaluate the patient and give recommendation to safety and appliance use at home i.e. walker.  Myself and one of her daughter's spoke today about the fact that she generally lives independently at the Brooke and she may need assisted living along with physical therapy and oxygen for a period of time rather than going back to independent living.\n2.  We will obtain an orthopedic consult secondary to her fall to evaluate her x-rays and function.

The next-door neighbor came over and decided that she should go to the emergency room to be check out for her generalized complaint of not feeling well.  The neighbor suspects that this may have been due to the patient taking too many of her Tylenol PM, which the patient has been known to do.

The adrenal lesion is a small lesion, appears as if probable benign adenoma, where as the pancreatic lesion is the cystic lesion, and neoplasm could not be excluded. \n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Both pancreatic and left adrenal lesions.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 60-year-old white male is referred to us by his medical physician with a complaint of recent finding of a both pancreatic lesion and lesions with left adrenal gland.  The patient's history dates back to at the end of the January of this past year when he began experiencing symptoms consistent with difficulty almost like a suffocating feeling whenever he would lie flat on his back.  He noticed whenever he would recline backwards, he would begin this feeling and it is so bad now that he can barely recline, very little before he has this feeling.  He is now sleeping in an upright position.  He was sent for CAT scan originally of his chest.  The CAT scan of the chest reveals a pneumonitis, but also saw a left adrenal nodule and a small pancreatic lesion.  He was subsequently was sent for a dedicated abdominal CAT scan and MRI.  The CAT scan revealed 1.8-cm lesion of his left adrenal gland, suspected to be a benign adenoma.  The pancreas showed pancreatic lesion towards the mid body tail aspect of the pancreas, approximately 1 cm, most likely of cystic nature.  Neoplasm could not be excluded.  He was referred to us for further assessment.  He denies any significant abdominal pain, any nausea or vomiting.  His appetite is fine.  He has had no significant changes in his bowel habits or any rectal bleeding or melena.  He has undergone a colonoscopy in September of last year and was found to have three adenomatous polyps.  He does have a history of frequent urination.  Has been followed by urologist for this.  There is no family history of pancreatic cancer.  There is a history of gallstone pancreatitis in the patient's sister.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, asthma, and high cholesterol.\n\nALLERGIES:  ENVIRONMENTAL.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Include glipizide 5 mg b.i.d., metformin 500 mg b.i.d., Atacand 16 mg daily, metoprolol 25 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 10 mg daily, pantoprazole 40 mg daily, Flomax 0.4 mg daily, Detrol 4 mg daily, Zyrtec 10 mg daily, Advair Diskus 100/50 mcg one puff b.i.d., and fluticasone spray 50 mcg two sprays daily.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  He has not had any previous surgery.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  His brothers had prostate cancer.  Father had brain cancer.  Heart disease in both sides of the family.  Has diabetes in his brother and sister.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a non-cigarette smoker and non-ETOH user.  He is single and he has no children.  He works as a payroll representative and previously did lot of work in jewelry business, working he states with chemical.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He denies any chest pain.  He admits to exertional shortness of breath.  He denies any GI problems as noted.  Has frequent urination as noted.  He denies any bleeding disorders or bleeding history.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nGENERAL:  Presents as an obese 60-year-old white male, who appears to be in no apparent distress.\nHEENT:  Unremarkable.\nNECK:  Supple.  There is no mass, adenopathy or bruit.\nCHEST:  Normal excursion.\nLUNGS:  Clear to auscultation and percussion.\nCOR:  Regular.  There is no S3 or S4 gallop.  There is no obvious murmur.\nHEART:  There is distant heart sounds.\nABDOMEN:  Obese.  It is soft.  It is nontender.  Examination was done as relatively sitting up as the patient was unable to recline.  Bowel sounds are present.  There is no obvious mass or organomegaly.\nGENITALIA:  Deferred.\nRECTAL:  Deferred.\nEXTREMITIES:  Revealed about 1+ pitting edema.  Bilateral peripheral pulses are intact.\nNEUROLOGIC:  Without focal deficits.  The patient is alert and oriented.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Both left adrenal and pancreatic lesions.  The adrenal lesion is a small lesion, appears as if probable benign adenoma, where as the pancreatic lesion is the cystic lesion, and neoplasm could not be excluded.  Given the location of these pancreatic lesions in the mid body towards the tail and size of 1 cm, the likelihood is an ERCP will be of no value and the likelihood is that it is too small to biopsy.  We are going to review x-rays with Radiology prior with the patient probably at some point will present for operative intervention.  Prior to that the patient will undergo an esophagogastroduodenoscopy.

Her creatinine is 2.2, which is right near her baseline of 2. We will continue to hydrate her and monitor her BMP closely.\n5. Urinary tract infection/hemorrhagic cystitis. She will be started on Cipro 400 mg IV daily. We will await the report of the abdominal ultrasound. Other things to consider would be pyelonephritis or renal stone.\n6. Obstructive sleep apnea. She will be continued on CPAP as previously ordered when she was an inpatient yesterday.\n7. Depression. We will consider a psych consult in the morning. She may have a psychological component to her nausea and vomiting.\n8. Case management to evaluate medication options. We need to make sure that she can afford all of her medications upon discharge.\n\nThis case was presented and thoroughly discussed with the senior resident who agrees with all medications and treatment.

The mother states that on Thursday, he developed fairly significant swelling, scrotum was also swollen, the suprapubic region was swollen, and he was having a purulent discharge and a fairly significant fever to 102 to 103.  He was seen at Hospital, transferred to Children's Hospital for further care.  Since being hospitalized, his cultures apparently have grown Staph but is unknown yet whether it is methicillin-resistant.  He has been placed on clindamycin, and he is now currently afebrile and with marked improvement according to the mother.  I was requested a consultation by Dr. X because of the appearance of penis.  The patient has been voiding without difficulty throughout.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has no known allergies.  He was a term delivery via vaginal delivery.  Surgeries; he has had 2 circumcisions.  No other hospitalizations.  He has had no heart murmurs, seizures, asthma, or bronchitis.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  A 14-point review of systems was negative with the exception of the penile and scrotal cellulitis and the surgeries as mentioned.  He also had an ear infection about 1 to 2 weeks before his circumcision.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with both parents and no siblings.  There are smokers at home.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Clindamycin and bacitracin ointment.  Also Bactrim.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nVITAL SIGNS:  Weight is 14.9 kg.\nGENERAL:  The patient was sleepy but easily arousable.\nHEAD AND NECK:  Grossly normal.  His neck and chest are without masses.\nNARES:  He had some crusted nares; otherwise, no other discharge.\nLUNGS:  Clear.\nCARDIAC:  Without murmurs or gallops.\nABDOMEN:  Soft without masses or tenderness.\nGU:  He has a fairly prominent suprapubic fat pad, and he is quite a large child in any event; however, there were no signs of erythema.  There was some induration around the penis; however, there were no signs of active infection.  He has a buried appearance of the penis after recent circumcision with a normal appearing glans.  The tissue itself, however, was quite dull and is soft or readily retractable at this time.  The scrotum was normal, and there was no erythema, there was no tenderness.  Both testes were descended without hydroceles.\nEXTREMITIES:  He has full range of motion of all 4 extremities.\nSKIN:  Warm, pink, and dry.\nNEUROLOGIC:  Grossly intact.\nBACK:  Normal.\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN:  The patient had a recent circumcision with a fairly prominent suprapubic fat pad but also has a penile and suprapubic cellulitis.  This is being treated, but it is most likely Staph and pending sensitivities.  I talked to the mother and told her that at this point the swelling that is present is a mixture of the resolving cellulitis from a suprapubic fat pad.  I recommended that he be treated most likely with Bactrim for a 10-day course at home, bacitracin, or some antibiotics ointment to the penis with each diaper change for the next 2 to 3 weeks with sitz bath once or twice a day.  I told the mother that initially the tissues are going to be quite dull because of the infection and the recent surgery, but she ultimately will have to gently retract the skin to keep it from adhering again because of the prominent suprapubic fat pad, which makes it more likely.  Otherwise, it is a fairly healthy-appearing tissue at the present time and she knows the reasons that he cannot be discharged once the hospitalist service believes that it is appropriate to do so.  He has a scheduled followup appointment with his urologist  and he should keep that appointment or followup sooner if there is any other problem arising.

The patient is a very poor historian and is extremely hard of hearing, and therefore, very little history is available. She was found by EMS sitting on the toilet having diarrhea, and apparently had also just vomited. Upon my questioning of the patient, she can confirm that she has been sick to her stomach and has vomited. She cannot tell me how many times. She is also unable to describe the vomitus. She also tells me that her belly has been hurting. I am unable to get any further history from the patient because, again, she is an extremely poor historian and very hard of hearing.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Per the ER documentation is hypertension, diverticulosis, blindness, and sciatica.\n\nMEDICATIONS: Lorazepam 0.5 mg, dosing interval is not noted; Tylenol PM; Klor-Con 10 mEq; Lexapro; calcium with vitamin D.\n\nALLERGIES: SHE IS ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY: Unknown.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: Also unknown.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Unobtainable secondary to the patient's condition.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nVITAL SIGNS: Pulse 80. Respiratory rate 18. Blood pressure 130/80. Temperature 97.6.\nGENERAL: Elderly black female who is initially sleeping upon my evaluation, but is easily arousable.\nNECK: No JVD. No thyromegaly.\nEARS, NOSE, AND THROAT: Her oropharynx is dry. Her hearing is very diminished.\nCARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rhythm. No lower extremity edema.\nGI: Mild epigastric tenderness to palpation without guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normoactive.\nRESPIRATORY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally with a normal effort.\nSKIN: Warm, dry, no erythema.\nNEUROLOGICAL: The patient attempts to answer questions when asked, but is very hard of hearing. She is seen to move all extremities spontaneously.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC DATA: White count 9.6, hemoglobin 15.9, hematocrit 48.2, platelet count 345, PTT 24, PT 13.3, INR 0.99, sodium 135, potassium 3.3, chloride 95, bicarb 20, BUN 54, creatinine 2.2, glucose 165, calcium 10.3, magnesium 2.5, total protein 8.2, albumin 3.8, AST 33, ALT 26, alkaline phosphatase 92. Cardiac isoenzymes negative x1. EKG shows sinus rhythm with a rate of 96 and a prolonged QT interval.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1. Pancreatitis. Will treat symptomatically with morphine and Zofran, and also IV fluids. Will keep NPO.\n2. Diarrhea. Will check stool studies.\n3. Volume depletion. IV fluids.\n4. Hyperglycemia. It is unknown whether the patient is diabetic. I will treat her with sliding scale insulin.\n5. Hypertension. If the patient takes blood pressure medications, it is not listed on the only medication listing that is available. I will prescribe clonidine as needed.\n6. Renal failure. Her baseline is unknown. This is at least partly prerenal. Will replace volume with IV fluids and monitor her renal function.\n7. Hypokalemia. Will replace per protocol.\n8. Hypercalcemia. This is actually rather severe when adjusted for the patient's low albumin. Her true calcium level comes out to somewhere around 12. For now, I will just treat her with IV fluids and Lasix, and monitor her calcium level.\n9. Protein gap. This, in combination with the calcium, may be suggestive of multiple myeloma. It is my understanding that the family is seeking hospice placement for the patient right now. I would have to discuss with the family before undertaking any workup for multiple myeloma or other malignancy.

She was brought in by the EMS service to Erlanger emergency department with pulseless electrical activity. Her husband states that he was at home with his wife, when she presented to him complaining of fever and chills. She became acutely unresponsive. She was noted to have worsening of her breathing. She took several of her MDIs and then was placed on her CPAP. He went to notify EMS and when he returned, she was found to not be breathing. He stated that she was noted to have no breathing in excess of 10 minutes. He states that the EMS system arrived at the home and she was found not breathing. The patient was intubated at the scene and upon arrival to Erlanger Medical Center, she was found to have pupils fixed and dilated. She was seen by me in the emergency department and was on Neo-Synephrine, dopamine with a blood pressure of 97/22 with a rapid heart rate and again, in an unresponsive state.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Review of systems was not obtainable.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes, osteoarthritis, hypertension, asthma, atrial fibrillation, diabetic foot ulcer and anemia.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Noncontributory to above.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY: Mother with history of coronary artery disease.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married. She uses no ethanol, no tobacco and no illicits. She has a very support family unit.\n\nMEDICATIONS: Augmentin; Detrol LA; lisinopril.\n\nIMMUNIZATIONS: Immunizations were up to date for influenza, negative for Pneumovax.\n\nALLERGIES: PENICILLIN.\n\nLABORATORY AT PRESENTATION: White blood cell count 11, hemoglobin 10.5, hematocrit 32.2, platelets 175,000. Sodium 148, potassium 5.2, BUN 30, creatinine 2.2 and glucose 216. PT was 22.4.\n\nRADIOLOGIC DATA: Chest x-ray revealed a diffuse pulmonary edema.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nVITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 97/52, pulse of 79, respirations 16, O2 sat 100%.\nHEENT: The patient's pupils were again, fixed and dilated and intubated on the monitor.\nCHEST: Poor air movement bilateral with bilateral rales.\nCARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm.\nABDOMEN: The abdomen was obese, nondistended and nontender.\nEXTREMITIES: Left diabetic foot had oozing pus drainage from the foot.\nGU: Foley catheter was in place.\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:\n1. Acute cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity with hypotensive shock and respiratory failure: Will continue ventilator support. Will rule out pulmonary embolus, rule out myocardial infarction. Continue pressors. The patient is currently on dopamine, Neo-Synephrine and Levophed.\n2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Will continue ventilatory support.\n3. Questionable sepsis: Will obtain blood cultures, intravenous vancomycin and Rocephin given.\n4. Hypotensive shock: Will continue pressors. Will check random cortisol. Hydrocortisone was added.\n\nFurther inpatient management for this patient will be provided by Dr. R. The patient's status was discussed with her daughter and her husband. The husband states that his wife has been very ill in the past with multiple admissions, but he had never seen her as severely ill as with this event. He states that she completely was not breathing at all and he is aware of the severity of her illness and the gravity of her current prognosis. Will obtain the assistance with cardiology with this admission and will continue pressors and supportive therapy. The family will make an assessment and final decision concerning her long-term management after a 24 hour period.

He is married, on medical leave from his job as a tree cutter, and lives with his wife and five children.\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT AND REACTION TO HOSPITALIZATION:  The patient is admitted on a 72-hour involuntary treatment for dangerousness to others after repeated assaultive behaviors at Hospital Emergency Room, the morning prior to admission.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was very sleepy this morning, only minimally cooperative with interview.  Additional information taken from the emergency room records that accompanied him from Hospital yesterday as well as from his wife, who I contacted by telephone.  The patient was apparently at his stable baseline when discharged from the Hospital on 01/21/10, status post back surgery following a work-related injury.  The patient returned to Emergency Room on the evening prior to admission complaining of severe back pain.  His ER course is notable for yelling, spitting, and striking multiple staff members.  The patient was originally to be admitted for pain control, but when he threatened to leave, he was referred to MHPs, who subsequently detained him for 72 hours for dangerousness to others.  On interview, the patient reports only hazy memories of these incidences and states this behavior was secondary to his pain and his medications.  He was contrite about the violence.  When his wife was contacted by telephone, she agreed with this assessment and reports that he has a history of domestic violence usually in the setting of alcohol and illicit substance intoxication, but denies any events in the last 3 years.\n\nHis wife reports that after discharge from the hospital, on 01/21/10, he was prescribed Percocet, Soma, hydroxyzine, and Valium.  He essentially exhausted his approximately 10 days' supply of these agents on the morning of 01/23/10, and as above believes that this was responsible for his presentation yesterday.  She reports that she has been in contact with him since his arrival in our facility and reports that he is &quot;back to normal.&quot; She denies feeling that he currently represents a threat to her or her five children.  She was unaware of his mental health history, but denies that he has received care for any condition since they were married three years ago.\n\nPAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:  The patient has a history of Involuntary Treatment Act of 72 hours in our facility in 2004 or 2005 for assaultive behaviors; however, these records are not currently available for review.  The patient denies any outpatient mental health treatment before or since this hospitalization.  He describes his mental health diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder; however, he denies a history of dramatic mood swings in the absence of illicit substances or alcohol intoxication.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for status post back surgery, discharged from Hospital on 01/21/10.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  From discharge from Hospital on 01/21/10, include Percocet, Valium, Soma, and Vistaril, doses and frequency are not currently known.  His wife reports that he was discharged with approximately 10 days' supply of these agents.\n\nSOCIAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY:  The patient is employed as a tree cutter, currently on medical leave for the last 2 months following a back injury.  He lives with his wife and children.  He has a history of domestic violence, but not recently.  Other details of occupational, educational history not currently known.\n\nSUBSTANCE AND ALCOHOL HISTORY:  Records indicate a previous history of methamphetamine and alcohol abuse/dependence.  The wife states that he has not consumed either since 12/07.  Of note, urine tox screen at Hospital was positive for marijuana.\n\nLEGAL HISTORY:  The patient has been charged with domestic violence in the past, but his wife denies any repeat instances since in the last 3 years.  It is not known whether the patient is currently on probation.\n\nGENETIC PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:  Unknown.\n\nMENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION:\nAttitude:  The patient is only minimally cooperative with interview secondary to being sleepy, and after repeated attempts to ask questions, he rolled over and went to bed.\nAppearance: He is unkempt and there are multiple visible tattoos on his biceps.\nPsychomotor:  There is no obvious psychomotor agitation or retardation.  There are no obvious extrapyramidal symptoms of tardive dyskinesia.\nAffect:  His affect is notably restricted probably due to the fact that he is sleepy.\nMood:  Describes his mood as &quot;okay.&quot;\nSpeech:  Speech is normal rate, volume, and tone.\nThought Processes:  His thought processes appear to be linear.\nThought Content:  His thought content is notable for his expressions of contrition about violence at Hospital last night.  He denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.\nCognitive Assessment:  Cognitively, he is alert and oriented to person, place, and date but not situation.  Attributes this to not really remembering the events at Hospital that resulted in this hospitalization.\nJudgment and Insight:  His insight and judgment are both appear to be improving.\nAssets:  Include his supportive wife and the fact he has been able to remain alcohol and methamphetamine sobriety for the last 3 years.\nLimitations:  Include his back injury and possible need for improvement of health treatment engagement.\n\nFORMULATION:  This is a 40-year-old white male, who was admitted for an acute agitation in the setting of misuse of prescribed opiates, Soma, hydroxyzine, and Valium.  He appears much improved from his condition at Hospital last night and I suspect that his behavior is most likely attributed to delirium and this since resolved.  He reports historical diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder, however, the details of this diagnosis are not currently available for review.\n\nDIAGNOSES:\nAXIS I:  Delirium, resolved (recent mental status changes likely secondary to misuse of prescribed opiates, Soma, Valium, and hydroxyzine.)  Rule out bipolar affective disorder.\nAXIS II:  Deferred.\nAXIS III:  Chronic pain status post back surgery.\nAXIS IV:  Appears to be moderate.  He is currently on medical leave from his job.\nAXIS V:  Global Assessment of Functioning is currently 50 (his GAF was 20 approximately 24 hours ago).\n\nESTIMATED LENGTH OF STAY:  Three days.\n\nPLAN:  I will hold psychiatric medications for now given the patient's fairly rapid improvement as he cleared from the condition, I suspect is likely due to misuse of prescribed medications.  The patient will be placed on CIWA protocol given that one of the medications he overused was Valium.  Of note, he does not currently appear to be withdrawing and I anticipate that his CIWA will be discontinued prior to discharge.  I would like to increase the database regarding the details of his historical diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder before pursuing referrals for outpatient mental health care.  The internal medicine service will evaluate for treatment for any underlying medical problems specifically to provide recommendations regarding pain management.

The patient has history of hypercholesterolemia, presently on Lipitor 20 mg a day and hyperthyroidism, on Synthroid 0.088 mg per day.  Also, history of chronic diverticulitis with recent bouts.  The patient has been doing well, seen in my office at the end of December for complete physical examination.  I had ordered a stress admin for him, then delayed due to a family illness.  However, denies any chest pain or chest tightness with exertion.  The patient was doing well.  He was watching television yesterday afternoon or p.m. and fell asleep holding his head in his left hand.  He awoke and noticed pain in the jaw and neck area, on both sides, but no shortness of breath, diaphoresis, nausea, or chest pain.  He is able to go to sleep, woke up this morning with same discomfort, decided to call our office, talked to our triage nurse, who instructed to come to the emergency room for possibility of just having a cardiac event.  The patient's pain resolved.  He was given nitroglycerin in the emergency room drawing his blood pressure 67/32.

The patient is referred to Medical Center's Outpatient Rehabilitation Department for skilled speech therapy, status post stroke.   \n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nMEDICAL DIAGNOSIS:  Strokes.\n\nSPEECH AND LANGUAGE THERAPY DIAGNOSIS:  Global aphasia.\n\nSUBJECTIVE:  The patient is a 44-year-old female who is referred to Medical Center's Outpatient Rehabilitation Department for skilled speech therapy, status post stroke.  The patient's sister-in-law was present throughout this assessment and provided all the patient's previous medical history.  Based on the sister-in-law's report, the patient had a stroke on 09/19/08.  The patient spent 6 weeks at XY Medical Center, where she was subsequently transferred to XYZ for therapy for approximately 3 weeks.  ABCD brought the patient to home the Monday before Thanksgiving, because they were not satisfied with the care the patient was receiving at a skilled nursing facility in Tucson.  The patient's previous medical history includes a long history of illegal drug use to include cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, and marijuana.  In March of 2008, the patient had some type of potassium issue and she was hospitalized at that time.  Prior to the stroke, the patient was not working and ABCD reported that she believes the patient completed the ninth grade, but she did not graduate from high school.  During the case history, I did pose several questions to the patient, but her response was often &quot;no.&quot;  She was very emotional during this evaluation and crying occurred multiple times.\n\nOBJECTIVE:  To evaluate the patient's overall communication ability, a Western Aphasia Battery was completed.  Also tests were not done due to time constraint and the patient's severe difficulty and emotional state.  Speech automatic tests were also completed to determine if the patient had any functional speech.\n\nASSESSMENT:  Based on the results of the Weston aphasia battery, the patient's deficits most closely resemble global aphasia.  On the spontaneous speech subtest, the patient responded &quot;no&quot; to all questions asked except for how are you today where she gave a thumbs-up.  She provided no responses to picture description task and it is unclear if the patient was unable to follow the direction or if she was unable to see the picture clearly.  The patient's sister-in-law did state that the patient wore glasses, but she currently does not have them and she did not know the extent the patient's visual deficit.\n\nOn the auditory verbal comprehension portion of the Western Aphasia Battery, the patient answered &quot;no&quot; to all &quot;yes/no&quot; questions.  The auditory word recognition subtest, the patient had 5 out of 60 responses correct.  With the sequential command, she had 10 out of 80 corrects.  She was able to shut her eyes, point to the window, and point to the pen after directions.  With repetition subtest, she repeated bed correctly, but no other stimuli.  At this time, the patient became very emotional and repeatedly stated &quot;I can't&quot;.  During the naming subtest of the Western Aphasia Battery, the patient's responses contained numerous paraphasias and her speech was often unintelligible due to jargon.  The word fluency admin was not administered and the patient scored 2 out of 10 on the sentence completion task and 0 out of 10 on the responsive speech.  In regards to speech automatics, the patient is able to count from 1 to 9 accurately; however, stated 7 instead of 10 at the end of the task.  She is not able to state the days of the week or months in the year or her name at this time.  She cannot identify the day on calendar and was unable to verbally state the date or month.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  The patient's communication deficits most closely resemble global aphasia where she has difficulty with both receptive as well as expressive communication.  She does perseverate and is very emotional due to probable frustration.  Outpatient skilled speech therapy is recommended to improve the patient's functional communication skills.\n\nPATIENT GOAL:  Her sister-in-law stated that they would like to improve upon the patient's speech to allow her to communicate more easily at home.\n\nPLAN OF CARE:  Outpatient skilled speech therapy two times a week for the next 12 weeks.  Therapy to include aphasia treatment and home activities.\n\nSHORT-TERM GOALS (8 WEEKS):\n1.  The patient will answer simple &quot;yes/no&quot; questions with greater than 90% accuracy with minimal cueing.\n2.  The patient will be able to complete speech automatic tasks with greater than 80% accuracy without models or cueing.\n3.  The patient will be able to complete simple sentence completion and/or phrase completion with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.\n4.  The patient will be able to follow simple one-step commands with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.\n5.  The patient will be able to name 10 basic everyday objects with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.\n\nSHORT-TERM GOALS (12 WEEKS):  Functional communication abilities to allow the patient to express her basic wants and needs.

Mom states she had no fever.  Her appetite was good but she was spitting up a lot.  She had no difficulty breathing and her cough was described as dry and hacky.  At that time, physical exam showed a right TM, which was red.  Left TM was okay.  She was fairly congested but looked happy and playful.  She was started on Amoxil and Aldex and we told to recheck in 2 weeks to recheck her ear.  Mom returned to clinic again today because she got much worse overnight.

Patient presented with symptoms of pneumonia and developed rapid sepsis and respiratory failure requiring intubation.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nDIAGNOSES:\n1.  Disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n2.  Streptococcal pneumonia with sepsis.\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Unobtainable as the patient is intubated for respiratory failure.\n\nCURRENT HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 20-year-old female who presented with symptoms of pneumonia and developed rapid sepsis and respiratory failure requiring intubation.  At this time, she is being treated aggressively with mechanical ventilation and other supportive measures and has developed disseminated intravascular coagulation with prolonged partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, low fibrinogen, and elevated D-dimer.  At this time, I am being consulted for further evaluation and recommendations for treatment.  The nurses report that she has actually improved clinically over the last 24 hours.  Bleeding has been a problem; however, it seems to have been abrogated at this time with factor replacement as well as platelet infusion.  There is no prior history of coagulopathy.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Otherwise nondescript as is the past surgical history.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  There were possible illicit drugs.  Her family is present, and I have discussed her case with her mother and sister.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Otherwise noncontributory.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Not otherwise pertinent.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nGENERAL:  She is a sedated, young black female in no acute distress, lying in bed intubated.\nVITAL SIGNS:  She has a rate of 67, blood pressure of 100/60, and the respiratory rate per the ventilator approximately 14 to 16.\nHEENT:  Her sclerae showed conjunctival hemorrhage.  There are no petechiae.  Her nasal vestibules are clear.  Oropharynx has ET tube in place.\nNECK:  No jugular venous pressure distention.\nCHEST:  Coarse breath sounds bilaterally.\nHEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.\nABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender with good bowel sounds.  There was some oozing around the site of her central line.\nEXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  There is no evidence of compromise arterial blood flow at the digits or of her hands or feet.\n\nLABORATORY STUDIES:  The DIC parameters with a platelet count of approximately 50,000, INR of 2.4, normal PTT at this time, fibrinogen of 200, and a D-dimer of 13.\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN:  At this time is disseminated intravascular coagulation from sepsis from pneumococcal disease.  My recommendation for the patient is to continue factor replacement as you are.  It seems that her clinical course is reversing and simple factor replacement is probably is the best measure at this time.  There is no indication at this point for Xigris.  However, if her coagulopathy does not resolve within the next 24 hours and continue to improve with an elevated fibrinogen, normalization of her coagulation times, I would consider low-dose continuous infusion heparin for abrogation of consumption of coagulation routines and continued supportive infusions.  I will repeat her laboratory studies in the morning and give more recommendations at that time.

The patient is a 16-year-old young lady with a history of thyroid mass that is now biopsy proven as papillary.  The pattern of miliary metastatic lesions in the chest is consistent with this diagnosis.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nREASON FOR CONSULTATION:  Thyroid mass diagnosed as papillary carcinoma.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 16-year-old young lady, who was referred from the Pediatric Endocrinology Department by Dr. X for evaluation and surgical recommendations regarding treatment of a mass in her thyroid, which has now been proven to be papillary carcinoma on fine needle aspiration biopsy.  The patient's parents relayed that they first noted a relatively small but noticeable mass in the middle portion of her thyroid gland about 2004.  An ultrasound examination had reportedly been done in the past and the mass is being observed.  When it began to enlarge recently, she was referred to the Pediatric Endocrinology Department and had an evaluation there.  The patient was referred for fine needle aspiration and the reports recently returned a diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma.  The patient has not had any hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, or any symptoms of endocrine dysfunction.  She has no weight changes consistent with either hyper or hypothyroidism.  There is no family history of thyroid cancer in her family.  She has no notable discomfort with this lesion.  There have been no skin changes.  Historically, she does not have a history of any prior head and neck radiation or treatment of any unusual endocrinopathy.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Essentially unremarkable.  The patient has never been hospitalized in the past for any major illnesses.  She has had no prior surgical procedures.\n\nIMMUNIZATIONS:  Current and up to date.\n\nALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Currently taking no routine medications.  She describes her pain level currently as zero.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  There is no significant family history, although the patient's father does note that his mother had a thyroid surgery at some point in life, but it was not known whether this was for cancer, but he suspects it might have been for goiter.  This was done in Tijuana.  His mom is from central portion of Mexico.  There is no family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a junior at Hoover High School.  She lives with her mom in Fresno.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  A careful 12-system review was completely normal except for the problems related to the thyroid mass.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nGENERAL:  The patient is a 55.7 kg, nondysmorphic, quiet, and perhaps slightly apprehensive young lady, who was in no acute distress.  She was alert and oriented x3 and had an appropriate affect.\nHEENT:  The head and neck examination is most significant.  There is mild amount of facial acne.  The patient's head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat appeared to be grossly normal.\nNECK:  There is a slightly visible midline bulge in the region of the thyroid isthmus.  A firm nodule is present there, and there is also some nodularity in the right lobe of the thyroid.  This mass is relatively hard, slightly fixed, but not tethered to surrounding tissues, skin, or muscles that I can determine.  There are some shotty adenopathy in the area.  No supraclavicular nodes were noted.\nCHEST:  Excursions are symmetric with good air entry.\nLUNGS:  Clear.\nCARDIOVASCULAR:  Normal.  There is no tachycardia or murmur noted.\nABDOMEN:  Benign.\nEXTREMITIES:  Extremities are anatomically correct with full range of motion.\nGENITOURINARY:  External genitourinary exam was deferred at this time and can be performed later during anesthesia.  This is same as too for her rectal examination.\nSKIN:  There is no acute rash, purpura, or petechiae.\nNEUROLOGIC:  Normal and no focal deficits.  Her voice is strong and clear.  There is no evidence of dysphonia or vocal cord malfunction.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:  I reviewed laboratory data from the Diagnostics Lab, which included a mild abnormality in the AST at 11, which is slightly lower than the normal range.  T4 and TSH levels were recorded as normal.  Free thyroxine was normal, and the serum pregnancy admin was negative.  There was no level of thyroglobulin recorded on this.  A urinalysis and comprehensive metabolic panel was unremarkable.  A chest x-ray was obtained, which I personally reviewed.  There is a diffuse pattern of tiny nodules in both lungs typical of miliary metastatic disease that is often seen in patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma.\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN:  The patient is a 16-year-old young lady with a history of thyroid mass that is now biopsy proven as papillary.  The pattern of miliary metastatic lesions in the chest is consistent with this diagnosis and is unfortunate in that it generally means a more advanced stage of disease.  I spent approximately 30 minutes with the patient and her family today discussing the surgical aspects of the treatment of this disease.  During this time, we talked about performing a total thyroidectomy to eradicate as much of the native thyroid tissue and remove the primary source of the cancer in anticipation of radioactive iodine therapy.  We talked about sentinel node dissection, and we spent significant amount of time talking about the possibility of hypoparathyroidism if all four of the parathyroid glands were damaged during this operation.  We also discussed the recurrent laryngeal and external laryngeal branches of the nerve supplying the vocal cord function and how they cane be damaged during the thyroidectomy as well.  I answered as many of the family's questions as they could mount during this stressful time with this recent information supplied to them.  I also did talk to them about the chest x-ray pattern, which was complete __________ as the film was just on the day prior to my clinic visit.  This will have some impact on the postoperative adjunctive therapy.  The radiologist commented about the risk of pulmonary fibrosis and the use of radioactive iodine in this situation, but it seems likely that is going to be necessary to attempt to treat this disease in the patient's case.  I did discuss with them the possibility of having to take large doses of calcium and vitamin D in the event of hypoparathyroidism if that does happen, and we also talked about possibly sparing parathyroid tissue and reimplanting it in a muscle belly either in the neck or forearm if that becomes a necessity.  All of the family's questions have been answered.  This is a very anxious and anxiety provoking time in the family.  I have made every effort to get the patient under schedule within the next 48 hours to have this operation done.  We are tentatively planning on proceeding this upcoming Friday afternoon with total thyroidectomy.

She was initially diagnosed with a glioblastoma multiforme.  She presented with several lesions in her brain and a biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. \n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nREASON FOR CONSULTATION:  We were asked to see the patient in regards to a brain tumor.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: She was initially diagnosed in September of this year with a glioblastoma multiforme.  She presented with several lesions in her brain and a biopsy confirmed the diagnosis.  She was seen by Dr. X in our group.  Because of her living arrangement, she elected to have treatment through the hospital radiation department and oncology department.  Details of her treatment are not available at the time of this dictation.  Her family has a packet of Temodar 100-mg pills.  She is admitted now with increasing confusion.  A CT shows increase in size of the lesions compared to the preoperative scan.  We are asked to comment on her treatment at this point.  She herself is confused and is unable to provide further history.  \n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  From her old chart:  No known past medical history prior to the diagnosis.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She was living alone and is now living in assisted living.  \n\nMEDICATIONS\n1.

Tylenol #3 as needed.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Unable.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\nGENERAL:  Elderly woman, confused.  \nHEENT:  Normal conjunctivae.  Ears and nose normal.  Mouth normal.\nNECK:  Supple.\nCHEST: Clear.\nHEART:  Normal.\nABDOMEN: Soft, positive bowel sounds.\nNEUROLOGIC:  Alert, cranial nerves intact.  Left arm slightly weak.  Left leg slightly weak.\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Glioblastoma multiforme, uncertain as to where she is in cancer treatment.  Given the number of pills in the patient's family's hands, it sounds like she has only been treated recently and therefore it is not surprising that she is showing increased problems related to increased size of the tumor.  We will have to talk with Dr. Y in the Clinic to get a better handle on her treatment regimen.  At this point, I will hold Temodar today and consider restarting it tomorrow if we can get her treatment plan clarified.

She remembers that the tremors started in her right hand around that time subsequently later on in early 20s she was put on propranolol for the tremor and more recently within the last 10 years she has been put on primidone and clonazepam.  She thinks that her clonazepam is helping her a lot especially with anxiety and stress, and this makes the tremor better.  She has a lot of trouble with her writing because of tremor but does not report as much problem with other activities of daily living like drinking from a cup and doing her day-to-day activity.  Since around 6 to 7 years, she has had a head tremor, which is mainly &quot;no- no&quot; and occasional voice tremor also.  Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura, which are far and few apart.  She also has some stress incontinence.

Language is intact.  Cranial nerves II through XII intact.  Motor examination showed 5/5 power in all extremities with minimal increased tone.  Sensory examination was intact to light touch.  Reflexes were brisk bilaterally, but they were equal and both toes were downgoing.  Her coordination showed minimal intentional component to bilateral finger-to-nose.  Gait was intact.  Lot of swing on Romberg's.  The patient did have a tremor both upper extremities, right more than left.  She did have a head tremor, which was no-no variety, and she had a minimal torticollis with her head twisted to the left.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This 62-year-old white female has essential tremor and mild torticollis.  Tremor not bothersome for most activities of daily living, but she does have a great difficulty writing, which is totally illegible.  The patient did not wish to change any of her medication doses at this point.  We will go ahead and check MRI brain, and we will get the films later.  We will see her back in 3 months.  Also, the patient declined any possible Botox for the mild torticollis she has at this point.

Basically the patient states that yesterday she fell and she is not certain about the circumstances, on her driveway, and on her left side hit a rock.  When she came to the emergency room, she was found to have a rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia, and was put on Cardizem with reportedly heart rate in the 50s, so that was stopped.  Review of EKGs from that time shows what appears to be multifocal atrial tachycardia with followup EKG showing wandering atrial pacemaker.  An ECG this morning showing normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.  Her potassium at that time was 3.1.  She does recall having palpitations because of the pain after the fall, but she states she is not having them since and has not had them prior.  She denies any chest pain nor shortness of breath prior to or since the fall.  She states clearly she can walk and she would be able to climb 2 flights of stairs without problems.\n\nPAST CARDIAC HISTORY:  She is followed by Dr. X in our office and has a history of severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild elevation and PA pressure.  On 05/12/08, preserved left and right ventricular systolic function, aortic sclerosis with apparent mild aortic stenosis, and bi-atrial enlargement.  She has previously had a Persantine Myoview nuclear rest-stress admin scan completed at ABCD Medical Center in 07/06 that was negative.  She has had significant mitral valve regurgitation in the past being moderate, but on the most recent echocardiogram on 05/12/08, that was not felt to be significant.  She has a history of hypertension and EKGs in our office show normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs versus wandering atrial pacemaker.  She does have a history of significant hypertension in the past.  She has had dizzy spells and denies clearly any true syncope.  She has had bradycardia in the past from beta-blocker therapy.\n\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:\n1.  Multivitamin p.o. daily.\n2.  Aspirin 325 mg once a day.\n3.  Lisinopril 40 mg once a day.\n4.  Felodipine 10 mg once a day.\n5.  Klor-Con 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d.\n6.  Omeprazole 20 mg p.o. daily presumably for GERD.\n7.  MiraLax 17 g p.o. daily.\n8.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. daily.\n\nALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN.  IT IS LISTED THAT TOPROL HAS CAUSED SHORTNESS OF BREATH IN HER OFFICE CHART AND I BELIEVE SHE HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT BRADYCARDIA WITH THAT IN THE PAST.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  She states her brother died of an MI suddenly in his 50s.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke cigarettes, abuse alcohol, nor use any illicit drugs.  She is retired from Morse Chain and delivering newspapers.  She is widowed.  She lives alone but has family members who live either on her property or adjacent to it.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies a history of stroke, cancer, vomiting of blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding, stomach ulcers.  She does not recall renal calculi, nor cholelithiasis, denies asthma, emphysema, pneumonia, tuberculosis, sleep apnea, home oxygen use.  She does note occasional peripheral edema.  She is not aware of prior history of MI.  She denies diabetes.  She does have a history of GERD.  She notes feeling depressed at times because of living alone.  She denies rheumatologic conditions including psoriasis or lupus.  Remainder of review of systems is negative times 15 except as described above.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:  Height 5 feet 0 inches, weight 123 pounds, temperature 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure has ranged from 160/87 with pulses recorded at being 144, and currently ranges 101/53 to 147/71, pulse 64, respiratory rate 20, O2 saturation 97%.  On general exam, she is a pleasant elderly woman who is hard of hearing, but is alert and interactive.  HEENT:  Shows cranium is  normocephalic and atraumatic.  She has moist mucosal membranes.  Neck veins were not distended.  There are no carotid bruits.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly without wheezes.  She is relatively immobile because of her left hip fracture.  Cardiac Exam:  S1, S2, regular rate, frequent ectopic beats, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, preserved aortic component of the second heart sound.  There is also a soft holosystolic murmur heard.  There is no rub or gallop.  PMI is nondisplaced.  Abdomen is soft and nondistended.  Bowel sounds present.  Extremities without significant clubbing, cyanosis, and there is trivial to 1+ peripheral edema.  Pulses appear grossly intact.  Affect is appropriate.  Visible skin warm and perfused.  She is not able to move because of left hip fracture easily in bed.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC STUDIES/LAB DATA:  Pertinent labs include chest x-ray with radiology report pending but shows only a calcified aortic knob.  No clear pulmonary vascular congestion.  Sodium 140, potassium 3.7, it was 3.1 on admission, chloride 106, bicarbonate 27, BUN 17, creatinine 0.9, glucose 150, magnesium was 2 on 07/13/06.  Troponin was 0.03 followed by 0.18.  INR is 0.93, white blood cell count 10.2, hematocrit 36, platelet count 115,000.\n\nEKGs are reviewed.  Initial EKG done on 08/19/08 at 1832 shows MAT, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, no ischemic changes.  She had a followup EKG done at 20:37 on 08/19/08, which shows wandering atrial pacemaker and some lateral T-wave changes, not significantly changed from prior.  Followup EKG done this morning shows normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.\n\nIMPRESSION:  She is an 84-year-old female with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension and mild aortic stenosis admitted after a fall with left hip fracture and she will require surgery.  Telemetry now reviewed, shows predominantly normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs _____ earlier yesterday evening showed burst of multifocal atrial tachycardia and I suspect that was exacerbated by prior hypokalemia, which has been corrected.  There has been no atrial fibrillation documented.  I do not feel these troponins are significant given the stress or fall in prior multifocal atrial tachycardia with increased rate especially in the absence of chest pain or shortness of breath.  She actually describes feeling good exercise capacity prior to this fall.  Given favorable risk to benefit ratio for needed left hip surgery, I feel she may proceed with needed left hip surgery from a cardiac standpoint with continued verapamil, which has been started, which should help control the multifocal atrial tachycardia, which she had and would watch for heart rate with that.  Continued optimization of electrolytes.  The patient cannot take beta-blockers as previously Toprol reportedly caused shortness of breath, although, there was some report that it caused bradycardia so we would watch her heart rate on the verapamil.  The patient is aware of the cardiac risks, certainly it is moderate, and wishes to proceed with needed surgery.  I do not feel any further cardiac evaluation is needed at this time and the patient may followup with Dr. X after discharge.  Regarding her mild thrombocytopenia, I would defer that to hospitalist and continue proton pump inhibitors for history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, management of left hip fracture as per orthopedist.

Belly and back pain.   Mild constipation.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Questionable foreign body, right nose.  Belly and back pain.  \n\nSUBJECTIVE:  Mr. ABC is a 2-year-old boy, who is brought in by parents, stating that the child keeps complaining of belly and back pain.  This does not seem to be slowing him down.  They have not noticed any change in his urine or bowels.  They have not noted him to have any fevers or chills or any other illness.  They state he is otherwise acting normally.  He is eating and drinking well.  He has not had any other acute complaints, although they have noted a foul odor coming from his nose.  Apparently, he was seen here a few weeks ago for a foreign body in the right nose, which was apparently a piece of cotton; this was removed and placed on antibiotics.  His nose got better and then started to become malodorous again.  Mother restarted him on the remainder of the antibiotics and they are also stating that they think there is something still in there.  Otherwise, he has not had any runny nose, earache, no sore throat.  He has not had any cough, congestion.  He has been acting normally.  Eating and drinking okay.  No other significant complaints.  He has not had any pain with bowel movement or urination, nor have they noted him to be more frequently urinating, then again he is still on a diaper.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Otherwise negative.\n\nALLERGIES:  No allergies.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  No medications other than recent amoxicillin.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Parents do smoke around the house.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Stable.  He is afebrile.\nGENERAL:  This is a well-nourished, well-developed 2-year-old little boy, who is appearing very healthy, normal for his stated age, pleasant, cooperative, in no acute distress, looks very healthy, afebrile and nontoxic in appearance.\nHEENT:  TMs, canals are normal.  Left naris normal.  Right naris, there is some foul odor as well as questionable purulent drainage.  Examination of the nose, there was a foreign body noted, which was the appearance of a cotton ball in the right nose, that was obviously infected and malodorous.  This was removed and reexamination of the nose was done and there was absolutely no foreign body left behind or residual.  There was some erythema.  No other purulent drainage noted.  There was some bloody drainage.  This was suctioned and all mucous membranes were visualized and are negative.\nNECK:  Without lymphadenopathy.  No other findings.\nHEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.\nLUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.\nABDOMEN:  His abdomen is entirely benign, soft, nontender, nondistended.  Bowel sounds active.  No organomegaly or mass noted.\nBACK:  Without any findings.  Diaper area normal.\nGU:  No rash or infections.  Skin is intact.\n\nED COURSE:  He also had a P-Bag placed, but did not have any urine.  Therefore, a straight catheter was done, which was done with ease without complication and there was no leukocytes noted within the urine.  There was a little bit of blood from catheterization but otherwise normal urine.  X-ray noted some stool within the vault.  Child is acting normally.  He is jumping up and down on the bed without any significant findings.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n1.  Infected foreign body, right naris.\n2.  Mild constipation.\n\nPLAN:  As far as the abdominal pain is concerned, they are to observe for any changes.  Return if worse, follow up with the primary care physician.  The right nose, I will place the child on amoxicillin 125 per 5 mL, 1 teaspoon t.i.d.  Return as needed and observe for more foreign bodies.  I suspect, the child had placed this cotton ball in his nose again after the first episode.

She did attend diabetes education classes at Abc Clinic.  She comes however, wanting to really work at weight reduction.  She indicates that she has been on the Atkins' diet for about two years and lost about ten pounds.  She is now following a veggie diet which she learned about in Poland originally.  She has been on it for three weeks and intends to follow it for another three weeks.  This does not allow any fruits or grains or starchy vegetables or meats.  She does eat nuts for protein.  She is wanting to know if she is at risk of having a severe low blood sugar reaction in this form of diet.  She also wants to know that if she gets skinny enough, if the diabetes will go away.  Her problem time, blood sugar wise, is in the morning.  She states that if she eats too much in the evening that her blood sugars are always higher the next morning.\n\nOBJECTIVE:  Weight:  189 pounds.  Reported height:  5 feet 5 inches.  BMI is approximately 31-1/2.  Diabetes medications include metformin 500 mg daily.  Lab from 5/12/04:  Hemoglobin A1C was 6.4%.\n\nA diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for weight reduction.  A 1200-calorie meal plan was recommended.\n\nASSESSMENT:  Patient's diet history reflects that she is highly restricting carbohydrates in her food intake.  She does not have blood sugar records with her for me to review, but we discussed strategies for improving blood sugar control in the morning.  This primarily included a recommendation of including some solid protein with her bedtime snack which could be done in the form of nuts.  She is doing some physical activity two to three times a week.  This includes aerobic walking with weights on her arms and her ankles.  She is likely going to need to increase frequency in this area to help support weight reduction.  Her basal metabolic rate was estimated at 1415 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirements for weight maintenance are estimated at 1881 calories a day.  A 1200-calorie meal plan should support a weight loss of at least one pound a week.\n\nPLAN:  Recommend patient increase the frequency of her walking to five days a week.  Encouraged a 30-minute duration.  Also recommend patient include some solid protein with her bedtime snack to help address fasting blood sugar elevations.  And lastly, I encouraged caloric intake of just under 1200 calories daily.  Recommend keeping food records and tracking caloric intake.  It is unlikely that her blood sugars would drop significantly low on the current dose of Glucophage.  However, I encouraged her to be careful not to reduce calories below 1000 calories daily.  She may want to consider a multivitamin as well.  This was a one-hour consultation.

The patient reports that she has resumed food record keeping which she feels like it has given her greater control.  Her physical activity level has remained high.  Her struggle times are in the mid-afternoon if she has not had enough food to eat, as well as in the evening after dinner.\n\nOBJECTIVE: Vital Signs:  Weight is 189-1/2 pounds.  Food records were reviewed\n\nASSESSMENT:  The patient has experienced a weight loss of 1-1/2 pounds in the last month.  She is commended for these efforts.  We have reviewed food records identifying that she has done a nice job keeping a calorie count for the last two or three weeks.  We discussed the value of this and how it was very difficulty to resume it, however, after she suspended the record keeping.  We also discussed its reflection that she is not getting very many fruits and vegetables on a regular basis.  We identified some ways of preventing her from feeling sluggish and having problems with low blood sugar in the middle of the afternoon by routinely planning an afternoon snack that can prevent these symptoms.  This will likely be around 2:30 or 3 p.m. for her.  We also discussed strategies for evening snacking to help put some definition and boundaries to the snacking.\n\nPLAN:  I recommended the patient routinely include an afternoon snack around 2:30 to 3 p.m.  It will be helpful if this snack includes some protein such as nuts or low-fat cheese.  She is also encouraged to continue with her record keeping for food choices and calorie points.  I also recommended she maintain her high level of physical activity.  Will plan to follow the patient in one month for ongoing support.  This was a 30-minute consultation.

Patient reports that she is scared to eat because of its impact on her blood sugars.  She is actually trying not to eat while she is working third shift at Wal-Mart.  Historically however, she likes to eat out with a high frequency.  She enjoys eating rice as part of her meals.  She is complaining of feeling fatigued and tired all the time because she works from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. at Wal-Mart and has young children at home.  She sleeps two to four hours at a time throughout the day.  She has been testing for ketones first thing in the morning when she gets home from work.\n\nOBJECTIVE:  Today's weight:  155.5 pounds.  Weight from 10/07/04 was 156.7 pounds.  A diet history was obtained.  Blood sugar records for the last three days reveal the following:  fasting blood sugars 83, 84, 87, 77; two-hour postprandial breakfast 116, 107, 97; pre-lunch 85, 108, 77; two-hour postprandial lunch 86, 131, 100; pre-supper 78, 91, 100; two-hour postprandial supper 125, 121, 161; bedtime 104, 90 and 88.  I instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for gestational diabetes.  The Lily Guide for Meal Planning was provided and reviewed.  Additional information on gestational diabetes was applied.  A sample 2000-calorie meal plan was provided with a carbohydrate budget established.\n\nASSESSMENT:  Patient's basal energy expenditure adjusted for obesity is estimated at 1336 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirements, including a physical activity factor as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals to 2036 calories per day.  Her diet history reveals that she has somewhat irregular eating patterns.  In the last 24 hours when she was working at Wal-Mart, she ate at 5 a.m. but did not eat anything prior to that since starting work at 10 p.m.  We discussed the need for small frequent eating.  We identified carbohydrate as the food source that contributes to the blood glucose response.  We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are all good for her.  The only carbohydrates she was asked to entirely avoid would be the concentrated forms of refined sugars.  In regard to use of her traditional foods of rice, I pulled out a one-third cup measuring cup to identify a 15-gram equivalent of rice.  We discussed the need for moderating the portion of carbohydrates consumed at one given time.  Emphasis was placed at eating with a high frequency with a goal of eating every two to four hours over the course of the day when she is awake.  Her weight loss was discouraged.  Patient was encouraged to eat more generously but with attention to the amount of carbohydrates consumed at a time.\n\nPLAN:  The meal plan provided has a carbohydrate content that represents 40 percent of a 2000-calorie meal plan.  The meal plan was devised to distribute her carbohydrates more evenly throughout the day.  The meal plan was meant to reflect an example for her eating, while the patient was encouraged to eat according to appetite and not to go without eating for long periods of time.  The meal plan is as follows:  breakfast 2 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, lunch 2-3 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, dinner 2-3 carbohydrate servings, bedtime snack 1-2 carbohydrate servings.  Recommend patient include a solid protein with each of her meals as well as with her snack that occurs before going to sleep.  Encouraged adequate rest.  Also recommend adequate calories to sustain weight gain of one-half to one pound per week.  If the meal plan reflected does not support slow gradual weight gain, then we will need to add more foods accordingly.  This was a one-hour consultation.  I provided my name and number should additional needs arise.

They wonder if the patient needs to lose anymore weight.\n\nOBJECTIVE:  The patient's weight today is 186-1/2 pounds, which is down 1-1/2 pounds in the past month.  He has lost a total of 34-1/2 pounds.  I praised this.  I went over his food diary and praised all of his positive food choices reported, especially his use of sugar-free Kool-Aid, sugar-free pudding, and diet pop.  I encouraged him to continue all of that, as well as his regular physical activity.\n\nASSESSMENT:  The patient is losing weight at an acceptable rate.  He needs to continue keeping a food diary and his regular physical activity.\n\nPLAN:  The patient plans to see Dr. XYZ at the end of May 2005.  I recommended that they ask Dr. XYZ what weight he would like for the patient to be at.  Follow up will be with me June 13, 2005.

Fatigue. Loose stools with some green color and also some nausea.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nSUBJECTIVE:  This patient presents to the office today because he has not been feeling well.  He was in for a complete physical on 05/02/2008.  According to the chart, the patient gives a history of feeling bad for about two weeks.  At first he thought it was stress and anxiety and then he became worried it was something else.  He says he is having a lot of palpitations.  He gets a fluttering feeling in his chest.  He has been very tired over two weeks as well.  His job has been really getting to him.  He has been feeling nervous and anxious.  It seems like when he is feeling stressed he has more palpitations, sometimes they cause chest pain.  These symptoms are not triggered by exertion.  He had similar symptoms about 9 or 10 years ago.  At that time he went through a full workup.  Everything ended up being negative and they gave him something that he took for his nerves and he says that helped.  Unfortunately, he does not remember what it was.  Also over the last three days he has had some intestinal problems.  He has had some intermittent nausea and his stools have been loose.  He has been having some really funny green color to his bowel movements.  There has been no blood in the stool.  He is not having any abdominal pain, just some nausea.  He does not have much of an appetite.  He is a nonsmoker.\n\nOBJECTIVE:  His weight today is 168.4 pounds, blood pressure 142/76, temperature 97.7, pulse 68, and respirations 16.  General exam:  The patient is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  There is no labored breathing.  Psychiatric:  He is alert and oriented times 3.  Ears:  Tympanic membranes pearly gray bilaterally.  Mouth:  No erythema, ulcers, vesicles, or exudate noted.  Eyes:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light bilaterally.  Neck is supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.  No rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.  Extremities:  No edema, cyanosis, or clubbing.\n\nASSESSMENT:  \n1.  Palpitations, possibly related to anxiety.\n2.  Fatigue.\n3.  Loose stools with some green color and also some nausea.  There has been no vomiting, possibly a touch of gastroenteritis going on here.\n\nPLAN:  The patient admits he has been putting this off now for about two weeks.  He says his work is definitely contributing to some of his symptoms and he feels stressed.  He is leaving for a vacation very soon.  Unfortunately, he is actually leaving Wednesday for XYZ, which puts us into a bit of a bind in terms of doing testing on him.  My overall opinion is he has some anxiety related issues and he may also have a touch of gastroenteritis.  A 12-lead EKG was performed on him in the office today.  This EKG was compared with the previous EKG contained in the chart from 2006 and I see that these EKGs look very similar with no significant changes noted, which is definitely a good news.  I am going to send him to the lab from our office to get the following tests done:  Comprehensive metabolic profile, CBC, urinalysis with reflex to culture and we will also get a chest X-ray.  Tomorrow morning I will manage to schedule him for an exercise stress admin at Bad Axe Hospital.  We were able to squeeze him in.  His appointment is at 8:15 in the morning.  He is going to have the stress admin done in the morning and he will come back to the office in the afternoon for recheck.  I am not going to be here so he is going to see Dr. X.  Dr. X should hopefully be able to call over and speak with the physician who attended the stress admin and get a preliminary result before he leaves for XYZ.  Certainly, if something comes up we may need to postpone his trip.  We petitioned his medical records from his former physician and with luck we will be able to find out what medication he was on about nine or ten years ago.  In the meantime I have given him Ativan 0.5 mg one tablet two to three times a day as needed for anxiety.  I talked about Ativan, how it works.  I talked about the side effects.  I told him to use it only as needed and we can see how he is doing tomorrow when he comes back for his recheck.  I took him off of work today and tomorrow so he could rest.

I had seen him the day before in my office and recommended him to go into the hospital.  He had just come from a trip to Taho in Nevada and he became homicidal while there.  He started having thoughts about killing his mother.  He became quite frightened by that thought and called me during the weekend we were able to see him on that Tuesday after talking to him.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a patient that has been suffering from a chronic psychotic condition now for a number of years.  He began to have symptoms when he was approximately 18 or 19 with auditory and visual hallucinations and paranoid delusions.

However, he has continued having intense and frequent psychotic bouts.  I have seen him now for approximately one year.  He has been quite refractory to treatment.  We tried different types of combination of medications, which have included Clozaril, Risperdal, lithium, and Depakote with partial response and usually temporary.  The patient has had starting with probably has had some temporary relief of the symptoms and they usually do not last more than a few days.  The dosages that we have used have been very high.  He has been on Clozaril 1200 mg combined with Risperdal up to 9 mg and lithium at a therapeutic level.  However, he has not responded.\n\nHe has delusions of antichrist.  He strongly believes that the dogs have a home in the neighborhood are communicating with him and criticizing him and he believes that all the people can communicate to him with telepathy including the animals.  He has paranoid delusions.  He also gets homicidal like prior to this admission.\n\nPAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:  As mentioned before, this patient has been psychotic off and on for about 20 years now.  He has had years in which he did better on Clozaril and also his other medications.\n\nWith typical anti-psychotics, he has done well at times, but he eventually gets another psychotic bout.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  He has a history of obesity and also of diabetes mellitus.  However, most recently, he has not been treated for diabetes since his last regular weight since he stopped taking Zyprexa.  The patient has chronic bronchitis.  He smokes cigarettes constantly up to 60 a day.\n\nDRUG HISTORY:  He stopped using drugs when he was 25.  He has got a lapse, but he was more than 10 years and he has been clean ever since then.  As mentioned before, he smokes cigarettes quite heavily and which has been a problem for his health since he also has chronic bronchitis.\n\nPSYCHOSOCIAL STATUS:  The patient lives with his mother and has been staying with her for a few years now.  We have talked to her.  She is very supportive.  His only sister is also very supportive of him.  He has lived in the ABCD houses in the past.  He has done poorly in some of them.\n\nMENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION:  The patient appeared alert, oriented to time, place, and person.  His affect is flat.  He talked about auditory hallucinations, which are equivocal in nature.  He is not homicidal in the hospital as he was when he was at home.  His voice and speech are normal.  He believes in telepathy.  His memory appears intact and his intelligence is calculated as average.\n\nINITIAL DIAGNOSES:\nAXIS I:  Schizophrenia.\nAXIS II:  Deferred.\nAXIS III:  History of diabetes mellitus, obesity, and chronic bronchitis.\nAXIS IV:  Moderate.\nAXIS V:  GAF of 35 on admission.\n\nINITIAL TREATMENT AND PLAN:  Since, the patient has been on high dosages of medications, we will give him a holiday and a structured environment.  We will put him on benzodiazepines and make a decision anti-psychotic later.  We will make sure that he is safe and that he addresses his medical needs well.

He comes in today with the chief complaint of low back pain which started about six to eight months ago.  He states that he does live here and also travels between here and Iowa and he does have a family in Iowa, which he is very active with his grandchildren doing shopping and plenty of walking.  He also recently cut down some trees.  He states that he started noticing some pain in his back and his hips and difficulty when beginning ambulation after getting up from a seated position due to the hip pains and the back pains.  He states he has not had any treatment for this problem.  He just does take Aleve.  He states that he began to wear a back brace, which only helps him some.  He says his pain is pretty manageable and low when he is not active, but it does increase with more activity that he does.  He is very leery about any surgical procedure, even a referral to come see us today for his brother most recently died from complications of back surgery.  He states that his back pain is intermittent.  On a 1 to 10 pain scale, he rates it a 2.  He has tried Aleve, which only helps him some.  On the body image drawing, he draws low back pain and bilateral hip pain, no radiating pain down the legs.  He describes his pain as 100% in low back and hip.  Lying down is the only alleviating factor.  Walking, light and heavy exercise exacerbate his pain.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  His parents are deceased.  He has two brothers ages 68 and 77 years old, who are healthy.  He has siblings, a brother and a sister who were twins who died at birth.  He has two sons 54 and 57 years old who are healthy.

On physical exam, the patient is alert and oriented with normal mentation and appropriate speech, in no acute distress.  HEENT exam, head is atraumatic and normocephalic.  Eyes, sclerae are anicteric.  Teeth, poor dentition.  Cranial nerves II, III, IV, and VI, vision intact, visual fields full to confrontation, EOMs full bilaterally, and pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Cranial nerves V and VII, normal facial sensation and symmetrical facial movements.  Cranial nerve VIII, hearing is intact.  Cranial nerves IX, X, and XII, tongue protrudes midline and palate elevates symmetrically.  Cardiac, regular rate, a holosystolic murmur is also noted which is about grade 1 to 2.  Chest and lungs are clear bilaterally.  Skin is warm and dry, normal turgor and texture.  No rashes or lesions are noted.  Peripheral vascular, no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema is noted.  General musculoskeletal exam reveals no gross deformities, fasciculations, or atrophy.  Station and gait are appropriate.  He ambulates well without any difficulties or assistance.  No antalgic or spastic gait is noted.  Examination of the low back reveals no paralumbar spasms.  He is nontender to palpation over his spinous process, SI joints, or paralumbar musculature.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally at the knees and 1+ at the ankles.  No ankle clonus is elicited.  Babinski, toes are downgoing.  Sensation is intact.\n\nHe does have some decreased sensation to pinprick, dull versus sharp over the right lower extremity compared to that of the left.  Strength is 5/5 and equal bilateral lower extremities.  He is able to ambulate on his toes and his heels without any weakness noted.  He has negative straight leg raising bilaterally.\n\nFINDINGS:  The patient brings in lumbar spine MRI for 11/15/2007, which demonstrates degenerative disc disease throughout.  At L4-L5 and L5-S1 he has severe disc space narrowing.  At L3-L4, he has degenerative changes of the facet with ligamentum flavum hypertrophy and annular disc bulge, which caused moderate neuroforaminal narrowing.  At L4-L5, degenerative changes within the facets with ligamentum flavum hypertrophy as well causing neuroforaminal narrowing and central stenosis.  At L5-S1, there is an annular disc bulge more to the right causing right-sided neuroforaminal stenosis, which is quite severe compared to that on the left.\n\nASSESSMENT:  Low back pain, degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis, diabetes, and history of prostate cancer status post radiation.\n\nPLAN:  We discussed treatment options with this patient including:\n1.  Do nothing.\n2.  Conservative therapies.\n3.  Surgery.\n\nThe patient states that his pain is very well tolerated by minimizing his activity and would like to do just pain management with some pain pills only as needed.  We went ahead and obtained an EKG in the office today due to the fact that I heard a murmur on exam.  I did phone the patient's primary care doctor, Dr. O.  Unfortunately Dr. O is out of the country, and I did speak with Dr. K, who is covering for Dr. O.  I informed Dr. K that the patient had a new-onset murmur and that I did have some concerns for the patient does not recollect having this diagnosis before, so I obtained an EKG.  A copy was provided to the patient and the patient was referred back to his primary care physician for workup.  He was also released from our care at this time to a p.r.n. basis, but the patient does not wish to proceed with any neurosurgical intervention nor any conservative measures besides medications, which he will receive from his primary doctor.\n\nAll questions and concerns were addressed.  If he should have any further questions, concerns, or complications, he will contact our office immediately.  Otherwise, we will see him p.r.n.  Warning signs and symptoms were gone over with him.  Case was reviewed and discussed with Dr. L.

She states that she cannot remember when it started and she has had back pain and knee pain for years but most recently it has gotten &quot;intolerable.&quot; She states that she has had many problems with her neck over the years, pictures taken in the late 1990s, but no treatment.  She had headaches, which were treated with antidepressants and Fiorinal, which helped her quite a bit.  She states that she was also married to a wife beater and suffered many episodes of severe beatings when she was younger.  She complains of back pain that radiates around her right hip and into the anterior thigh as well as bilateral knee pain.  She states that her pain is constant.  On a 1 to 10 pain scale, she rates it between a 6 and a 10.  She has tried Fiorinal, which helps with her headaches.  Currently, she is doing physical therapy for her back.  She has also seen several different chiropractors over the years.  On the body image drawing, she draws posterior neck pain, head pain, and right shoulder pain.  She also draws numbness and tingling in her right hand.  She draws pain in her back going into the right hip and down the anterior aspect of the right leg and bilateral knee pain.  She states that her back hurts her more than her legs.  When it comes to her legs, her right is worse than left.  Knee pain is worse on the left than on the right.  She is unable to identify any alleviating factors.  Walking, standing, sitting, lying down, coughing, sneezing, working, and light and heavy exercise exacerbate her pain.  Bowel movements make no difference in her pain.  She describes pain as being 70% in the low back, 15% in the right leg, 15% in right buttock, and 50% in the left knee.  She states that she can no longer bend her knee completely and her back pain is so severe that at times she cannot move.  If she bends over it feels like someone has hit her in the back.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Her father died from leukemia.  Her mother died from kidney and heart failure.

She denies any bowel or bladder dysfunction or loss of sensation in her genital area.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is 5 feet 2 inches tall.  Current weight is 132 pounds, weight one year ago was 126 pounds.  BP is 122/68.  On physical exam, patient is alert and oriented with normal mentation and appropriate speech, in no acute distress.  General, a well-developed and well-nourished female in no acute distress.  HEENT exam, head is atraumatic and normocephalic.  Eyes, sclerae are anicteric.  Teeth good dentition.  Cranial nerves II, III, IV, and VI, vision is intact, visual fields are full to confrontation, EOMs full bilaterally, and pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Cranial nerves V and VII, normal facial sensation and symmetrical facial movement.  Cranial nerve VIII, hearing intact.  Cranial nerves IX, X, and XII, tongue protrudes midline and palate elevates symmetrically.\n\nCranial nerve XI, strong and symmetrical shoulder shrugs against resistance.  Cardiac, regular rate and rhythm.  Chest and lungs are clear bilaterally.  Skin is warm and dry, normal turgor and texture.  No rashes or lesions are noted.  General musculoskeletal exam reveals no gross deformities, fasciculations, or atrophy.  Peripheral vascular, no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  Examination of the low back reveals some mild paralumbar spasms.  She is nontender to palpation of her spinous processes, SI joints, and paralumbar musculature.  She does have some poking sensation to deep palpation into the left buttock where she describes some zinging sensation.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilateral knees and ankles.  No ankle clonus is elicited.  Babinski, toes are downgoing.  Straight leg raising is negative bilaterally.  Strength on manual exam is 5/5 and equal bilateral lower extremity.  She is able to ambulate on her toes and her heels without any difficulty.  She is able to get up standing on one foot on to the toes.

She also has positive Patrick/FABER on the right with pain with internal and external rotation, negative on the left.  Sensation is intact.  She has good accuracy to pinprick, dull versus sharp.\n\nFINDINGS:  The patient brings in lumbar spine MRI dated November 20, 2007, which demonstrates degenerative disc disease throughout.  At L4-L5, there is an annular disc bulge with fissuring with facet arthrosis and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy yielding moderate central stenosis and neuroforaminal narrowing but the nerves do not appear to be impinged.  At L5-S1, in the right neuroforamina, there appears to be soft tissue density just lateral and posterior to the nerve root, which may cause some displacement, but it is unclear.  This could represent a facet synovial cyst.  This is lateral to the facet.  She does not have x-rays for review.  She has had hip and knee x-rays taken but does not bring them in with her.\n\nASSESSMENT:  Low back pain, lumbar radiculopathy, degenerative disc disease, lumbar spinal stenosis, history of anemia, high cholesterol, and hypothyroidism.\n\nPLAN:  We discussed treatment options with this patient including:\n1  Do nothing.\n2.  Conservative therapies.\n3.  Surgery.\n\nShe seems to have some issues with her right hip, so I would like for her to fax us over the report of her hip and knee x-rays.  We will also order some x-rays of her lumbar spine as well as lower extremity EMG.\n\nAt this point, the patient has not exhausted conservative measures and would like to start with epidural steroid injections, so we will go ahead and send her out for that.  After she has gotten her second epidural injection, she will return to the office for a followup visit to see how she is doing.  All questions and concerns were addressed.  If she should have any further questions, concerns, or complications, she will contact our office immediately.  Otherwise, we will see her as scheduled.  Case was reviewed and discussed with Dr. L.

Symptoms started in June of 2006, when the patient complained of vision problems and disorientation.  The patient was seen wearing clothes inside out along with other unusual behaviors.  In August or September of 2006, the patient reported having a sudden onset of headaches, loss of vision, and talking sporadically without making any sense.  The patient sought treatment from an ophthalmologist.  We did not find any abnormality in the Behavior Center in Tyler, Texas.  The Behavior Center referred the patient to Dr. Abc, a neurologist in Tyler, who then referred the patient to this hospital.\n\nAccording to the mother, the patient has had no past major medical or psychiatric illnesses.  The patient was functioning normally before June 2006, working as accounting tech after having completed 2 years of college.  She reports of worsening in symptoms, mainly unable to communicate about auditory or visual hallucinations or any symptoms of anxiety.  Currently, the patient lives with mother and requires her assistance to perform ADLs and the patient has become ataxic since November 2006.  Sleeping patterns and the amount is unknown.  Appetite is okay.\n\nPAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:  The patient was diagnosed with severe depression in November 2006 at the Behavior Center in Tyler, Texas, where she was given Effexor.  She stopped taking it soon after, since they worsened her eye vision and balance.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  In 2001 diagnosed with Meniere disease, was treated such that she could function normally in everyday activities including work.  No current medications.  Denies history of seizures, strokes, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, or head injury.\n\nFAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY:  Father's grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer disease in her 70s with symptoms similar to the patient described by the patient's mother.  Both, the mother's father and father's mother had &quot;nervous breakdowns&quot; but at unknown dates.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with a mother, who takes care of the patient's ADLs.  The patient completed school, up to two years in college and worked as accounting tech for eight years.  Denies use of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs.\n\nMENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION:  The patient is 33-year-old black female wearing clean clothes, a small towel on her head and over a wheel chair with her head rested on a pillow and towel.  Decreased motor activity, but did blink her eyes often, but arrhythmically.  Poor eye contact.  Speech illogic.  Concentration was not able to be assessed.  Mood is unknown.  Flat and constricted affect.  Thought content, thought process and perception could not be assessed.  Sensorial memory, information, intelligence, judgment, and insight could not be evaluated due to lack of communication by the patient.\n\nMINI-MENTAL STATUS EXAM:  Unable to be performed.\n\nAXIS I:  Rapidly progressing early onset of dementia, rule out dementia secondary to general medical condition, rule out dementia secondary to substance abuse.\nAXIS II:  Deferred.\nAXIS III:  Deferred.\nAXIS IV:  Deferred.\nAXIS V:  1.\n\nASSESSMENT:  The patient is a 32-year-old black female with rapid and early onset of dementia with no significant past medical history.  There is no indication as to what precipitated these symptoms, as the mother is not aware of any factors and the patient is unable to communicate.  The patient presented with headaches, vision forms, and disorientation in June 2006.  She currently presents with ataxia, vision loss, and illusions.\n\nPLAN:  Wait for result of neurological tests.  Thank you very much for the consultation.

The patient states she is having increasing symptoms of pain and discomfort associated with recurrence of bunion deformity on the right foot and pain localized to the second toe and MTP joint of the right foot as well.  The patient had prior surgery performed approximately 13 years ago.  She states that since the time of the original surgery the deformity has slowly recurred, and she has noticed progressive deformity in the lesser toes at the second and third toes of the left foot and involving the second toe of the right foot.  The patient is employed on her feet as a hospital employee and states that she does wear a functional orthotic which does provide some relief of forefoot pain although not complete.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, SOCIAL HISTORY & REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  See Patient History sheet, which was reviewed with the patient and is signed in the chart.  Past medical history on the patient, past surgical history, current medications, drug-related allergies and social history have all been updated and reviewed, and enclosed in the chart.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical exam reveals a pleasant, 57-year-old female who is 5 feet 4 inches and 150 pounds.  She has palpable pulses.  Neurologic sensation is intact.  Examination of the extremities shows the patient as having well-healed surgical sites from her arthroplasty, second digits bilaterally and prior bunionectomy.  There is a recurrence of bunion deformity noted on both great toes although the patient notes to have reasonably good range of movement.  She has particular pain in the second MTP joint of the right foot and demonstrates a mild claw-toe deformity of the second and third toes to the left foot, and to a lesser degree the second toe to the right.  Gait analysis:  The patient stands and walks with a rather severe pes planus and has generalized hypermobility noted in the feet.\n\nX-RAY INTERPRETATION:  X-rays taken today; three views to the right foot shows presence of internal K-wire and wire from prior bunionectomy.  Biomechanical analysis shows 15 degree intermetatarsal angle and approximately 45 degree hallux abducto valgus angle.  No evidence of arthrosis in the joint is noted.  Significant shift to the fibular sesamoid is present.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n1.  Recurrent bunion deformity, right forefoot.\n2.  Pes planovalgus deformity, bilateral feet.\n\nPLAN/TREATMENT:\n1.  Today, we did review remaining treatment options with the patient including the feasibility of conservative versus surgical treatment.  The patient would require an open wedge osteotomy to reduce the intermetatarsal angle with the lateral release and a decompression osteotomy  at the second metatarsal.  Anticipated length of healing was noted for the patient as were potential risks and complications.  The patient ultimately would probably require surgery on her left foot at a later date as well.\n2.  The patient will explore her ability to get out of work for the above-mentioned period of time and will be in touch with regards regarding scheduling at a later date.\n3.  All questions were answered.

He has not eaten anything, and has vomited 8 times.  AF reports 10/10 pain in the LLQ.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  AF's past medical history is significant for an abdominal injury during the Vietnam War which required surgery, and multiple episodes of small bowel obstruction and abdominal pain.  Other elements of his history include alcoholism, cocaine abuse, alcoholic hepatitis, hepatitis C positive, acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, appendicitis, liver hematoma/contusion, Hodgkin's Disease, constipation, diarrhea, paralytic ileus, anemia, multiple blood transfusions, chorioretinitis, pneumonia, and &quot;crack chest pain&quot; \n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  AF has had multiple abdominal surgeries, including Bill Roth Procedure Type 1 (partial gastrectomy) during Vietnam War, at least 2 exploratory laparotomies and enterolysis procedures (1993; 2000), and appendectomy\n\nMEDICATIONS:  None.\n\nALLERGIES:  Iodine, IV contrast (anaphylaxis), and seafood/shellfish.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  AF was born and raised in San Francisco.  His father was an alcoholic.  He currently lives with his sister, and does not work; he collects a pension.\n\nHEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIORS:  AF reports that he smokes 1 to 2 cigarettes per day, and drinks 40 ounces of beer per day.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Noncontributory, except that patient reports a 6 pound weight loss since his symptoms began, and reports multiple transfusions for anemia.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital Signs:  T:  37.1      BP:  127/94        HR:  125        RR:  16   O2 Sat:  95% room air.\nGeneral:  50 year old African-American man in acute distress, writhing on gurney and rubbing abdomen.\nSkin:  well healed abdominal scar extending along the linea alba, from the xiphoid process to the pubic tubercle; another scar at McBurney's Point, about 3 or 4 inches long.\nHEENT:  PERRL, EOMI, O/P clear-dry.\nNeck:  Supple, no LAD.\nHeart:  Tachycardic, regular rhythm; nl S1 & S2; 2/6 systolic murmur heard best over left sternal border.\nLungs:  CTAB.\nAbdomen:  Multiple scars (see Skin); firm and distended; TTP, especially in LLQ, with rebound tenderness; guarding difficult to assess secondary to distention; tinkling and high-pitched bowel sounds, particularly in upper quadrants; ventral hernia near umbilicus.\nRectal:  Normal tone, guiac negative.\nExtremities:  Mormal.\nVascular:  Normal distal pulses.\nLymphatics:  Enlarged, nontender anterior cervical and inguinal lymph nodes.\nNeurological:  A&OX4 and cooperative.\n\nSTUDIES:\nCXR:  Clear lung fields; NGT in stomach.\nAbdominal CT:  Low attenuation signal in internal superior left lobe of the liver, distended sludge-filled gallbladder, 8mm dilated CBD, no free air, no free fluid, small bowel loops consistent with but not definitive of obstruction.\n\nASSESSMENT:  AF is a 50-year-old African-American man with abdominal pain and distention, obstipation, and vomiting.  The differential diagnosis includes paralytic ileus and mechanical obstruction.  Paralytic ileus, which is characterized by absence of bowel sounds, gas scattered in the GI tract, dilation of the entire bowel, and a recent abdominal surgery, is unlikely in this case.  AF is more likely suffering from a bowel obstruction:  he has multiple risk factors (past abdominal surgery, multiple episodes of obstruction from adhesions) and symptoms and signs (bowel sounds, vomiting) consistent with obstruction.\n\nMechanical bowel obstruction can be caused by:\n1.  Adhesions (most cases):  typically from prior surgeries.\n2.  Hernias (second most common cause).\n3.  Tumors (15% of cases):  rare in small intestine; most common cause of large intestine obstruction.\n4.  Intussusception (especially in kids).\n5.  Volvulus (especially in elderly).\n6.  Obturation:  fecal impactions, gallstone ileus, parasitic infections.\n7.  Inflammatory lesions:  TB, regional enteritis, ulcerative colitis, amebiasis.\n8.  Vascular obstruction:  embolism, increased venous pressure, hypercoagulability, vascular disease; especially in elderly.\n\nGiven the patient's history of multiple abdominal surgeries and adhesions causing small bowel obstruction, AF's obstruction is most likely caused by adhesions.\n\nOne question to answer in any patient presenting with bowel obstruction is whether the obstruction is in the small or large intestine.  In small bowel obstruction, the pain is sharp and frequent, with early vomiting and electrolyte imbalance.  In contrast, large bowel obstruction may present in elderly patients without vomiting, and typically without hernias or a history of abdominal surgery.  Radiographic studies can definitively locate the site of the obstruction.  In this patient, though the radiographic evidence was equivocal, the presence of vomiting and the quality and frequency of his pain suggested small bowel obstruction.\n\nPLAN:  There has been a great deal of debate about the best way to treat patients with mechanical obstruction.  I will focus on the question of whether a patient should be managed conservatively or with an operation.  This question is vital because mechanical obstruction may lead to strangulation and perforation, life-threatening consequences.  There is no reliable way to determine whether the patient is already suffering from strangulated bowel, and next to impossible to predict which patients will suffer from strangulation.\n\nPatients that have hernias are sent immediately to the operating room for a repair; the surgeon will resect any nonviable bowel.  For patients suffering from an obstruction due to adhesions, the decision becomes difficult.  Fifteen percent of these patients may have strangulating obstruction.  Simple (nonstrangulating) bowel obstruction typically presents with intermittent, colicky pain.  Strangulating obstruction, in contrast, usually presents with steady unrelenting pain.  Other signs include a palpable mass, increased temperature and heart rate, and lab studies indicating acute inflammation.\n\nSeveral studies have examined the ability of these signs to predict when strangulation is present.  After a study of 238 patients with small bowel obstruction, Stewardson et al. (1978) suggest that physicians, instead of considering individual signs, look at a combination of &quot;classic findings&quot; including leukocytosis, fever, tachycardia, and localized tenderness.  They recommend conservative treatment only for patients with none or only one of these signs.  Ninety percent of patients with strangulated bowel had two or more signs.  Bizer et al. (1981), on the other hand, found no correlation between these signs and the presence of strangulation.  They did find a correlation with age, feculent vomiting, peristaltitic sounds, and a white cell count above 18,000.\n\nIt is clear that there are no absolute guidelines determining whether a patient can be treated conservatively or must get an operation.  Improvements in imaging techniques in the recent past have aided in these critical decisions.  Computed tomography can frequently be used to diagnose strangulation, however in the majority of cases misses the diagnosis.  Apparently, the decision to operate ultimately falls on the judgment of the surgeon who must take into account all of the findings in combination.\n\nThe operative treatment of mechanical obstruction is removing the obstruction resecting nonviable bowel, and creating a bypass if necessary.  Conservative treatment primarily includes decompression, rehydration, and frequent monitoring.  The physician must also decide on what type of tube should be used to decompress, and how long the nonoperative treatment will be attempted before resorting to surgery.  The question of the tube has been a controversy for years, some advocating the nasogastric tube for all patients, others advocating a nasointestinal tube for distal obstructions.  Maglinte et al. (2001) explain that nasointestinal tubes are more effective at decompressing distal obstructions, and suggest that physicians use a multipurpose tube that can be used as a nasogatric tube, a nasointestinal tube, and a diagnostic tool (can provide route for enteroclysis).  Nasogastric tubes are especially unable to decompress distal distention in patients with a competent pyloric sphincter.\n\nFinally, the length of the trial period of nonoperative management is also debatable.  Seror et al. (1993) suggest a 5-day trial to allow time for spontaneous resolution, and report a 73% success rate in a study of patients with a history of bowel surgery.  In contrast, Deutsch et al. (1989) suggest only a 24 hour trial of conservative therapy, and only for patients with partial obstruction.  Again, it appears as though this decision presently is at the discretion of the surgeon caring for the patient.\n\nIn the case of patient AF, his findings made the decision to operate particularly difficult.  He was clearly tachycardic; his WBC was elevated, but not above 18,000.  His abdominal pain was steady and unrelenting, and could be localized to the LLQ, but he was afebrile.  His abdominal CT was consistent with small bowel obstruction, but not definitive.  In the end, based on the team's desire to avoid another abdominal surgery that could lead to more adhesions and another obstruction, we chose conservative management, with nasogastric tube decompression, rehydration, and close observation.

No facial swelling.  No tongue or lip swelling.  No shortness of breath, wheezing, or other associated symptoms.  He cannot think of anything that could have triggered this off.  There have been no changes in his foods, medications, or other exposures as far as he knows.  He states a couple of days ago he did work and was removing some insulation but does not remember feeling itchy that day.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Negative for chronic medical problems.  No local physician.  Has had previous back surgery and appendectomy, otherwise generally healthy.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As mentioned denies any oropharyngeal swelling.  No lip or tongue swelling.  No wheezing or shortness of breath.  No headache.  No nausea.  Notes itchy rash, especially on his torso and upper arms.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is accompanied with his wife.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Negative.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  None.\n\nALLERGIES:  TORADOL, MORPHINE, PENICILLIN, AND AMPICILLIN.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  The patient was afebrile.  He is slightly tachycardic, 105, but stable blood pressure and respiratory rate.  GENERAL:  The patient is in no distress.  Sitting quietly on the gurney.  HEENT:  Unremarkable.  His oral mucosa is moist and well hydrated.  Lips and tongue look normal.  Posterior pharynx is clear.  NECK:  Supple.  His trachea is midline.  There is no stridor.  LUNGS:  Very clear with good breath sounds in all fields.  There is no wheezing.  Good air movement in all lung fields.  CARDIAC:  Without murmur.  Slight tachycardia.  ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender.  SKIN:  Notable for a confluence erythematous, blanching rash on the torso as well as more of a blotchy papular, macular rash on the upper arms.  He noted some on his buttocks as well.  Remaining of the exam is unremarkable.\n\nED COURSE:  The patient was treated with epinephrine 1:1000, 0.3 mL subcutaneously along with 50 mg of Benadryl intramuscularly.  After about 15-20 minutes he states that itching started to feel better.  The rash has started to fade a little bit and feeling a lot more comfortable.\n\nIMPRESSION:  ACUTE ALLERGIC REACTION WITH URTICARIA AND PRURITUS.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient has what looks to be some type of allergic reaction, although the underlying cause is difficult to assess.  He will make sure he goes home to look around to see if there is in fact anything that changed recently that could have triggered this off.  In the meantime, I think he can be managed with some antihistamine over-the-counter.  He is responding already to Benadryl and the epinephrine that we gave him here.  He is told that if he develops any respiratory complaints, shortness of breath, wheezing, or tongue or lip swelling he will return immediately for evaluation.  He is discharged in stable condition.

He awoke during the night with severe ear pain, and mom states that this is the third time this year he has had earaches.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient reports that he felt good after taking antibiotics with each earache episode and has recently started on the wrestling team.  Mom reports that patient has been afebrile with each of the earache episodes, and he has not had upper respiratory symptoms.  Patient denies any head trauma associated with wrestling practice.\n\nBIRTH AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY:  Patient's mother reports a normal pregnancy with no complications, having received prenatal care from 12 weeks.  Vaginal delivery was uneventful with a normal perinatal course.  Patient sat alone at 6 months, crawled at 9 months, and walked at 13 months.  His verbal and motor developmental milestones were as expected.\n\nFAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient lives with both parents and two siblings (brother - age 11 years, sister - age 15 years).  He reports enjoying school, remains active in scouts, and is very excited about being on the wresting team.  Mom reports that he has several friends, but she is concerned about the time required for the wrestling team.  Patient is in 8th grade this year and an A/B student.  Both siblings are healthy.  His Dad has hypertension and has frequent heartburn symptoms that he treats with over-the-counter (OTC) medications.  Mom is healthy and has asthma.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Patient has been seen in the clinic yearly for well child exams.  He has had no major illnesses or hospitalizations.  He had one emergency room visit 2 years ago for a knee laceration.  Patient has been healthy except for the past year when he had two episodes of otitis media not associated with respiratory infections.  He received antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin) for the otitis media and both episodes resolved without problems.  Patient's Mom states that he takes no prescribed medications or OTC medications, but he admits that he has been taking his dad's OTC Pepcid AE sometimes when he gets heartburn.  Upon further examination, he reports taking Pepcid when he eats pizza or Mexican food.  He does complain of sore throats sometimes and often feels burning in his throat when he goes to sleep at night after a late evening snack.\n\nNUTRITIONAL HISTORY:  Patient eats cereal bars or pop tarts with milk for breakfast most days.  He takes his lunch (usually a sandwich and chips or yogurt and fruit) for lunch.  Mom or his sister cooks supper in the evening.  The family goes out to eat once or twice a week and he only gets &quot;fast food&quot; once or twice a week according to his Mom.  He says he eats &quot;a lot&quot; especially after a wrestling meet.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nHeight/weight:  Patient weighs 109 pounds (60th percentile) and is 69 inches tall (93rd percentile).  He is following the growth pattern he established in infancy.\nVital signs:  BP 110/60, T 99.2, HR 70, R 16.\nGeneral:  Alert, cooperative but a bit shy.\nNeuro:  DTRs symmetric, 2+, negative Romberg, able to perform simple calculations without difficulty, short-term memory intact.  He responds appropriately to verbal and visual cues, and movements are smooth and coordinated.\nHEENT:  Normocephalic, PEERLA, red reflex present, optic disk and ocular vessels normal.  TMs deep red, dull, landmarks obscured, full bilaterally.  Post auricular and submandibular nodes on left are palpable and slightly tender.\nLungs:  CTA, breath sounds equal bilaterally, excursion and chest configuration normal.\nCardiac:  S1, S2 split, no murmurs, pulses equal bilaterally.\nAbdomen:  Soft, rounded, reports no epigastric tenderness but states that heartburn begins in epigastric area and rises to throat.  Bowel sounds active in all quadrants.  No hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness.  No CVA tenderness.\nMusculoskeletal:  Full range of motion, all extremities.  Spine straight, able to perform jumping jacks and duck walk without difficulty.\nGenital:  Normal male, Tanner stage 4.  Rectal exam - small amount of soft stool, no fissures or masses.\n\nLABS:  Stool negative for blood and H. pylori antigen.  Normal CBC and urinalysis.  A barium swallow and upper GI was scheduled for the following week.  It showed marked GE reflux.\n\nASSESSMENT:  The differential diagnoses for patient included (a) chronic otitis media/treatment failure, (b) peptic ulcer disease/gastritis, (c) gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD) or carbonated beverage syndrome, (d) trauma.\n\nCHRONIC OTITIS MEDIA.  Chronic otitis media due to a penicillin resistant organism would be the obvious diagnosis in this case.  It is rare for an adolescent to have otitis media with no precipitating factor (such as being on a swim team or otherwise exposed to unusual organisms or in an unusual environment).  It is certainly unusual for him to have three episodes in 1 year.\n\nPEPTIC ULCER DISEASE.  There were no symptoms of peptic ulcer disease, a negative H. pylori screen and lack of pain made this diagnosis less likely.  Trauma.  Trauma was a possibility, particularly since adolescent males frequently minimize symptoms especially if they might limit participation in a sport but patient maintained that he had not had an event where he struck his head or neck and that he always wore his helmet with ear padding.\n\nGERD.  The history of &quot;heartburn&quot; relieved by his father's medication was striking.  The positive study supported the diagnosis of GERD, which was severe and chronic enough to cause irritation of the mucosal surfaces exposed to the gastric juices and edema, inflammation in the inner ears.\n\nPLAN:  Patient and his Mom agreed to a trial of omeprazole 20 mg at bedtime for 2 weeks.  Patient was to keep a diary of any episodes of heartburn, including what foods seemed to aggravate it.  The clinician asked him to avoid using any antacid products in the meantime to gage the effectiveness of the medication.  He was also given a prescription for 10 days of Augmentin99 and a follow-up appointment for 2 weeks.  At his follow-up appointment he reported one episode after he ate a whole large pizza after wrestling practice but said it went away pretty quickly after he took his medication.  A 6-month follow up appointment was scheduled.

She states she has it at least once a day.  It can be any time, but can also be postprandial.  She states she will vomit up some dark brown-to-green fluid.  There has been no hematemesis.  She states because of the nausea and vomiting, she has not been able to take much in the way of PO intake over the past week.  She states her appetite is poor.  The patient has lost 40 pounds of weight over the past 16 months.  She states for the past few days, she has been getting severe heartburn.  She used Tums over-the-counter and that did not help.  She denies having any dysphagia or odynophagia.  She is not having any abdominal pain.  She has no diarrhea, rectal bleeding, or melena.  She has had in the past, which was remote.  She did have some small amounts of rectal bleeding on the toilet tissue only if she passed a harder stool.  She has a history of chronic constipation for most of her life but she definitely has a bowel movement every 3 to 4 days and this is unchanged.  The patient states she has never had any endoscopy or barium studies of the GI tract.\n\nThe patient is anemic and her hemoglobin is 5.7 and she is thrombocytopenic with the platelet count of 34.  She states she has had these abnormalities since she has been diagnosed with breast cancer.  She states that she has metastatic breast cancer and that is in her rib cage and spine and she is getting hormonal chemotherapy for this and she is currently under the care of an oncologist.  The patient also has acute renal failure at this point.  The patient said she had a PET scan done about a week ago.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Metastatic breast cancer to her rib cage and spine, hypothyroidism, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, Bells palsy, depression, uterine fibroids, hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, breast lumpectomy, and thyroidectomy.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\nMEDICINES:  She is on Zofran, Protonix, fentanyl patch, Synthroid, Ativan, and Ambien.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is divorced and is a homemaker.  No smoking or alcohol.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Negative for any colon cancer or polyps.  Her father died of mesothelioma, mother died of Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nSYSTEMS REVIEW:  No fevers, chills or sweats.  She has no chest pain, palpitations, coughing or wheezing.  She does get shortness of breath, no hematuria, dysuria, arthralgias, myalgias, rashes, jaundice, bleeding or clotting disorders.  The rest of the system review is negative as per the HPI.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:  Temperature 98.4, blood pressure 95/63, heart rate 84, respiratory rate of 18, and weight is 108 kg.  GENERAL APPEARANCE:  The patient was comfortable in bed.  Skin exam is negative for any rashes or jaundice.  LYMPHATICS:  There is no palpable lymphadenopathy of the cervical or the supraclavicular area.  HEENT:  She has some mild ptosis of the right eye.  There is no icterus.  The patient's conjunctivae and sclerae are normal.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  No lesions of the oral mucosa or mucosa of the pharynx.  NECK:  Supple.  Carotids are 2+.  No thyromegaly, masses or adenopathy.  HEART:  Has regular rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2.  She has a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.  No rubs or gallops.  Lungs are clear to percussion and auscultation.  Abdomen is obese, it may be mildly distended.  There is no increased tympany.  The patient does have hepatosplenomegaly.  There is no obvious evidence of ascites.  The abdomen is nontender, bowel sounds are present.  The extremities show some swelling and edema of the ankle regions bilaterally.  Legs are in SCDs.  No cyanosis or clubbing.  For the rectal exam, it shows brown stool that is very trace heme positive at most.  For the neuro exam, she is awake, alert, and oriented x3.  Memory intact.  No focal deficits.  Insight and judgment are intact.\n\nX-RAY AND LABORATORY DATA:  She came in, white count 9.2, hemoglobin 7.2, hematocrit 22.2, MCV of 87, platelet count is 47,000.  Calcium is 8.1, sodium 134, potassium 5.3, chloride 102, bicarbonate 17, BUN of 69, creatinine of 5.2, albumin 2.2, ALT 28, bilirubin is 2.2, alkaline phosphatase is 359, AST is 96, and lipase is 30.  Today, her hemoglobin is 5.7, TSH is 1.1, platelet count is 34,000, alkaline phosphatase is 303, and bilirubin of 1.7.\n\nIMPRESSION\n1.  The patient has one week of nausea and vomiting with decreased p.o. intake as well as dehydration.  This could be on the basis of her renal failure.  She may have a viral gastritis.  The patient does have a lot of gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms recently.  She could have peptic mucosal inflammation or peptic ulcer disease.\n2.  The patient does have hepatosplenomegaly.  There is a possibility she could have liver metastasis from the breast cancer.\n3.  She has anemia as well as thrombocytopenia.  The patient states this is chronic.\n4.  A 40-pound weight loss.\n5.  Metastatic breast cancer.\n6.  Increased liver function tests.  Given her bone metastasis, the elevated alkaline phosphatase may be from this as opposed to underlying liver disease.\n7.  Chronic constipation.\n8.  Acute renal failure.\n\nPLAN:  The patient will be on a clear liquid diet.  She will continue on the Zofran.  She will be on IV Protonix.  The patient is going to be transfused packed red blood cells and her hemoglobin and hematocrit will be monitored.  I obtained the result of the abdominal x-rays she had done through the ER.  The patient has a consult pending with the oncologist to see what her PET scan show.  There is a renal consult pending.  I am going to have her get a total abdominal ultrasound to see if there is any evidence of liver metastasis and also to assess her kidneys.  Her laboratory studies will be followed.  Based upon the patient's medical condition and including her laboratory studies including a platelet count, we talked about EGD versus upper GI workup per upper GI symptoms.  I discussed informed consent for EGD.  I discussed the indications, risks, benefits, and alternatives.  The risks reviewed included, but were not limited to an allergic reaction or side effect to medicines, cardiopulmonary complications, bleeding, infection, perforation, and needing to get admitted for antibiotics or blood transfusion or surgery.  The patient voices her understanding of the above.  She wants to think about what she wants to do.  Overall, this is a very ill patient with multiorgan involvement.

In the past, Accutane has been used.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nREASON FOR CONSULTATION:  Recurrent abscesses in the thigh, as well as the pubic area for at least about 2 years.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 23-year-old female who is approximately 5 months' pregnant, who has had recurrent abscesses in the above-mentioned areas.  She would usually have pustular type of lesion that would eventually break and would be quite painful.  The drainage would be malodorous.  It would initially not be infected as far as she knows, but then could eventually become infected.  She stated that this first started after she had her first born about 2 years ago.  She had recurrences of these abscesses and had pain, actually hospitalized at Hospital approximately a year and a half ago for about 1-1/2 months.  She was treated with multiple courses of antibiotics.  She had biopsies done.  She was seen by Dr. X.  Reportedly, she had a HIV admin done that was negative.  She had been seen by a dermatologist who said that she had a problem with her sweat glands.  She has been on multiple courses of antibiotics.  She never had any fevers.  She has pain, drainage, and reportedly there was some bleeding in the area of the perineum/vaginal area.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1.  History of recurrent abscesses in the perineum, upper medial thigh, and the vulva area for about 2 years.  Per her report, a dermatologist had told her that she had an overactive sweat gland, and I believe she probably has hidradenitis suppurativa.  Probably, she has had Staphylococcus infection associated with it as well.\n2.  Reported history of asthma.\n\nGYNECOLOGIC HISTORY:  G3, P1.  She is currently 5 months' pregnant.\n\nALLERGIES:  None.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Her medication had been Augmentin.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She is followed by a gynecologist in Bartow.  She is not an alcohol or tobacco user.  She is not married.  She has a 2-year-old child.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient has been complaining of diarrhea about 5 or 6 times a day for several weeks now.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\nGENERAL:    The patient is a pleasant female lying in bed in no acute distress.\nVITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.4, pulse 78, respirations 18, and blood pressure 81/49.\nLUNGS:    Clear to auscultation.\nHEART:    Regular rhythm.\nABDOMEN:    Soft.\nGENITAL AREA:  There are some multiple scars and some tender indurated areas in her pubic area.  There appears to be a tender area in the right inguinal/perineal area that is draining clear fluid.  I do not see any obvious blood.  There are multiple scars in the inguinal fold area as well as the upper medial thigh.  I do not see any obvious active fluctuant lesion.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  WBC count is 13.9, hemoglobin 11.1, and platelets 291,000.  BUN 7, creatinine 0.7, and glucose 80.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1.  Recurrent hidradenitis suppurativa, which sometimes may become superinfected with skin organisms when it ruptures and drains.  It is essentially overactive sebaceous glands that become abscess.  In the past, Accutane has been used.  Obviously, she cannot get this.  I do not know what new treatments are available by dermatologist.  I usually refer these patients to dermatologist.  I do not think she has an obvious current abscessed lesion, although there is some drainage.  She has been on Augmentin for 1 month.\n2.  Diarrhea in a patient who had been on Augmentin for 1 month.  Need to rule out Clostridium difficile colitis.\n3.  Mild leukocytosis.\n4.  Intrauterine pregnancy, 5 months' pregnant.\n\nPLAN:  Would not continue antibiotics when the patient is discharged since the patient would be at increased risk for developing resistant organisms as well as developing side effects such as Clostridium difficile colitis.  Check Clostridium difficile toxin.  I agree about trying to arrange for whirlpool therapy as an outpatient since plain sitz bath is not working currently.  Refer to dermatologist as an outpatient.

She follows up at the wound care center at Hospital.  Her lower extremity edema is being managed there.  She has had multiple episodes of cellulitis of the lower extremities for which she has received treatment with oral Bactrim and ciprofloxacin in the past according to her.  As her lymphedema was not improving on therapy at that facility, she was referred for admission to Long-Term Acute Care Facility for lymphedema management.  She at present has a stage II ulcer on the lower part of the medial aspect of left leg without any drainage and has slight erythema of bilateral lower calf and shin areas.  Her measurements for lymphedema wraps have been taken and in my opinion, it is going to be started in a day or two.\n\nI have been consulted to rule out the possibility of lower extremity cellulitis that may require antibiotic therapy.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Positive for morbid obesity, chronic lymphedema of the lower extremities, at least for the last three years, spastic colon, knee arthritis, recurrent cellulitis of the lower extremities.  She has had a hysterectomy and a cholecystectomy in the remote past.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives by herself and has three pet cats.  She is an ex-smoker, quit smoking about five years ago.  She occasionally drinks a glass of wine.  She denies any other recreational drugs use.  She recently retired from State of Pennsylvania as a psychiatric aide after 32 years of service.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for mother passing away at the age of 38 from heart problems and alcoholism, dad passed away at the age of 75 from leukemia.  One of her uncles was diagnosed with leukemia.\n\nALLERGIES:  ADHESIVE TAPE ALLERGIES.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  At present, the patient is admitted with a nonresolving bilateral lower extremity lymphedema, which is a little bit more marked on the right lower extremity compared to the left.  She denies any nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.  She denies any pain, tenderness, increased warmth or drainage from the lower extremities.  Denies chest pain, cough or phlegm production.  All other systems reviewed were negative.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nGeneral:  A 51-year-old morbidly obese Caucasian female who is not in any acute hemodynamic distress at present.\nVital signs:  Her maximum recorded temperature since admission today is 96.8, pulse is 65 per minute, respiratory rate is 18 to 20 per minute, blood pressure is 150/54, I do not see a recorded weight at present.\nHEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Head is normocephalic and external ear exam is normal.\nNeck:  Supple.  There is no palpable lymphadenopathy.\nCardiovascular system:  Regular rate and rhythm of the heart without any appreciable murmur, rub or gallop.  Heart sounds are little distant secondary to thick chest wall.\nLungs:  Clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally.\nAbdomen:  Morbidly obese, soft, nontender, nondistended, there is no percussible organomegaly, there is no evidence of lymphedema on the abdominal pannus.  There is no evidence of cutaneous candidiasis in the inguinal folds.  There is no palpable lymphadenopathy in the inguinal and femoral areas.\nExtremities:  Bilateral lower extremities with evidence of extensive lymphedema, there is slight pinkish discoloration of the lower part of calf and shin areas, most likely secondary to stasis dermatosis.  There is no increased warmth or tenderness, there is no skin breakdown except a stage II chronic ulcer on the lower medial aspect of the right calf area.  It has minimal serosanguineous drainage and there is no surrounding erythema.  Therefore, in my opinion, there is no current evidence of cellulitis or wound infection.  There is no cyanosis or clubbing.  There is no peripheral stigmata of endocarditis.\nCentral nervous system:  The patient is alert and oriented x3, cranial nerves II through XII are intact, and there is no focal deficit appreciated.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  White cell count is 7.4, hemoglobin 12.9, hematocrit 39, platelet count of 313,000, differential is normal with 51% neutrophils, 37% lymphocytes, 9% monocytes and 3% eosinophils.  The basic electrolyte panel is within normal limits and the renal function is normal with BUN of 17 and creatinine of 0.5.  Liver function tests are also within normal limits.\n\nThe nasal screen for MRSA is negative.  Urine culture is negative so far from admission.  Urinalysis was negative for pyuria, leucocyte esterase, and nitrites.\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  A 51-year-old Caucasian female with multiple medical problems mentioned above including history of morbid obesity and chronic lower extremity lymphedema.  Admitted for inpatient management of bilateral lower extremity lymphedema.  I have been consulted to rule out possibility of active cellulitis and wound infection.\n\nAt present, I do not find evidence of active cellulitis that needs antibiotic therapy.  In my opinion, lymphedema wraps could be initiated.  We will continue to monitor her legs with lymphedema wraps changes 2 to 3 times a week.  If she develops any cellulitis, then appropriate antibiotic therapy will be initiated. \n\nHer stage II ulcer on the right leg does not look infected.  I would recommend continuation of wound care along with lymphedema wraps.\n\nOther medical problems will continue to be followed and treated by Dr. X's group during this hospitalization.  Dr. Y from Plastic Surgery and Lymphedema Management Clinic is following.\n\nI appreciate the opportunity of participating in this patient's care.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at any time.  I will continue to follow the patient along with you 2-3 times per week during this hospitalization at the Long-Term Acute Care Facility.

Dr. X performed the procedure, thoracentesis on 6/12/2009 both diagnostic and therapeutic.  Dr. Y's results pending.\n\nDISPOSITION:  The patient discharged to long-term acute facility under the care of Dr. Z.\n\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Clinically improved, however, requiring acute care.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Include those on admission combined with IV Flagyl 500 mg every 8 hours and Levaquin 500 mg daily.\n\nHOSPITAL SUMMARY:  This is one of several admissions for this 68-year-old female who over the initial 48 hours preceding admission had a complaint of low-grade fever, confusion, dizziness, and a nonproductive cough.  Her symptoms progressed and she presented to the emergency room at Brighton Gardens where a chest x-ray revealed evolving right lobar infiltrate.  She was started on antibiotics.  Infectious Disease was consulted.  She was initially begun on vancomycin.  Blood, sputum, and urine cultures were obtained; the results of which were negative for infection.  She was switched to IV Levaquin and received IV Flagyl for possible C. diff colitis as well as possible cholecystitis.  During her hospital stay, she initially was extremely relatively hypotensive with mild symptoms and she became dizzy with upright positioning.  Her systolic blood pressure was 60-70 mmHg despite rather aggressive IV fluid management up to 250 mL an hour.  She was seen in consultation by Dr. Y who monitored her fluid and pulmonary treatment.  Due to some elevated liver function tests, she was seen in consultation by Dr. X.  An ultrasound was negative; however, she did undergo CT scan of the chest and abdomen and there was a suspicion of fluid circling the gallbladder.  A HIDA scan was performed and revealed no evidence of gallbladder dysfunction.  Liver functions were monitored throughout her stay and while elevated, did reduce to approximately 1.5 times normal value.  She also was seen in consultation by Infectious Disease who followed her for several days and agreed with current management of antibiotics.  Over her week-stay, the patient was moderately hypoxemic with room air pulse oximetry of 90%.  She was placed on incentive spirometry and over the succeeding days, she did have improved pulmonary function.\n\nLABORATORY TESTS:  Initially revealed a white count of 13,000, however, approximately 24 hours following admission her white count stabilized and in fact remained normal throughout her stay.  Blood cultures were negative at 5 days.  Sputum culture was negative.  Urine culture was negative and thoracentesis culture negative at 24 hours.  The patient did receive 2 units of packed red cells with the hemoglobin drop to 9 for cardiovascular support, as no evidence of GI bleeding was obtained.  Her most recent blood work on 6/14/2009 revealed a white count of 7000 and hemoglobin of 12.1 with a hematocrit of 36.8.  Her PT and PTT were normal.  Occult blood studies were negative for occult blood.  Hepatitis B antigen was negative.  Hepatitis A antibody IgM was negative.  Hepatitis B core IgM negative, and hepatitis C core antibody was negative.  At the time of discharge on 6/14/2009, sodium was 135, potassium was 3.7, calcium was 8.0, her ALT was 109, AST was 70, direct bilirubin was 0.2, LDH was 219, serum iron was 7, total iron unbound 183, and ferritin level was 267.\n\nAt the time of discharge, the patient had improved.  She complained of some back discomfort and lumbosacral back x-ray did reveal some evidence of mild degenerative disk disease with no obvious compression fracture acute noted and she will be followed by Dr. Z.

According to the patient, she had stable blood pressure for the past 12-15 years on 10 mg of lisinopril.  In August of 2007, she was treated with doxorubicin and, as well as Procrit and her blood pressure started to go up to over 200s.  Her lisinopril was increased to 40 mg daily.  She was also given metoprolol and HCTZ two weeks ago, after she visited the emergency room with increased systolic blood pressure.  Denies any physical complaints at the present time.  Denies having any renal problems in the past.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above plus history of anemia treated with Procrit.  No smoking or alcohol use and lives alone.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Unremarkable.\n\nPRESENT MEDICATIONS:  As above.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Cardiovascular:  No chest pain.  No palpitations.  Pulmonary:  No shortness of breath, cough, or wheezing.  Gastrointestinal:  No nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.  GU:  No nocturia.  Denies having gross hematuria.  Salt intake is minimal.  Neurological:  Unremarkable, except for history of old CVA.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure today is 182/78.  Examination of the head is unremarkable.  Neck is supple with no JVD.  Lungs are clear.  There is no abdominal bruit.  Extremities 1+ edema bilaterally.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Urinalysis done in the office shows 1+ proteinuria; same is shown by urinalysis done at Hospital.  The creatinine is 0.8.  Renal ultrasound showed possible renal artery stenosis and a 2 cm cyst in the left kidney.  MRA of the renal arteries was essentially unremarkable with no suspicion for renal artery stenosis.\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Accelerated hypertension.  No clear-cut etiology for recent worsening since renal artery stenosis was ruled out by negative MRA.  I could only blame Procrit initiation, as well as possible fluid retention as a cause of the patient's accelerated hypertension.  She was started on hydrochlorothiazide less than two weeks ago with some improvement in her hypertension.  At this point, I would not pursue a diagnosis of renal artery stenosis.  Since she is maxed out on lisinopril and her pulse is 60, I would not increase beta-blocker or ACE inhibitor.  I will continue HCTZ at 24 mg daily.  The patient was also given a sample of Tekturna, which would hopefully improve her systolic blood pressure.  The patient was told to be stick with her salt intake.  She will report to me in 10 days with the result of her blood pressure.  She will also repeat an SMA7 to rule out possible hyperkalemia due to Tekturna.

The patient has normal speech.  PSYCHIATRIC:  The patient is alert and oriented x4.  Normal mood and affect.  HEMATOLOGIC/LYMPHATIC:  There is no evidence of bruising noted to the body.  No lymphadenitis is palpated.\n\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT TESTING:  CBC was done, which had a hemoglobin of 7.7 and hematocrit of 22.6.  Neutrophils were 81%.  The RDW was 18.5, and the rest of the values were all within normal limits and unremarkable.  Chemistry had a sodium of 134, a glucose of 132, calcium is 8.2, and rest of the values are unremarkable.  Alkaline phosphatase was 770 and albumin was 2.4.  Rest of the values all are within normal limits of the LFTs.  Urinalysis was grossly bloody with a large amount of blood and greater than 50 rbc's.  The patient also had greater than 300 of the protein reading, moderate leukocytes, 30-50 white blood cells, but no bacteria were seen.  Coagulation profile study had a PT of 15.9, PTT of 43 and INR of 1.3.\n\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was given normal saline 2 liters over 1 hour without any adverse effect.  The patient was given multiple doses of morphine to maintain his comfort while here in the emergency room without any adverse effect.  The patient was given Levaquin 500 mg by mouth as well as 2 doses of Phenergan over the course of his stay here in the emergency department.  The patient did not have an adverse reaction to these medicines either.  Phenergan resolved his nausea and morphine did relieve his pain and make him pain free.  I spoke with Dr. X, the patient's urologist, about most appropriate step for the patient, and Dr. X said he would be happy to care for the patient in the hospital and do urologic scopes if necessary and surgery if necessary and blood transfusion.  It was all a matter of what the patient wished to do given the advanced stage of his cancer.  Dr. X was willing to assist in any way the patient wished him to.  I spoke with the patient and his son about what he would like to do and what the options were from doing nothing from keeping him comfortable with pain medicines to admitting him to the hospital with the possibility of scopes and even surgery being done as well as the blood transfusion.  The patient decided to choose a middle ground in which he would be transfused with 2 units of blood here in the emergency room and go home tonight.  The patient's son felt comfortable with his father's choice.  This was done.  The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells after appropriately typed and match.  The patient did not have any adverse reaction at any point with his transfusion.  There was no fever, no shortness of breath, and at the time of disposition, the patient stated he felt a little better and felt like he had a little more strength.  Over the course of the patient's several-hour stay in the emergency room, the patient did end up developing enough problems with clotted blood in his bladder that he had a urinary obstruction.  Foley catheter was placed, which produced bloody urine and relieved the developing discomfort of a full bladder.  The patient was given a leg bag and the Foley catheter was left in place.\n\nDIAGNOSES\n1.  HEMATURIA.\n2.  PROSTATE CANCER WITH BONE AND BLADDER METASTATIC DISEASE.\n3.  SIGNIFICANT ANEMIA.\n4.  URINARY OBSTRUCTION.\n\nCONDITION ON DISPOSITION:  Fair, but improved.\n\nDISPOSITION:  To home with his son.\n\nPLAN:  We will have the patient follow up with Dr. X in his office in 2 days for reevaluation.  The patient was given a prescription for Levaquin and Phenergan tablets to take home with him tonight.  The patient was encouraged to drink extra water.  The patient was given discharge instructions on hematuria and asked to return to the emergency room should he have any worsening of his condition or develop any other problems or symptoms of concern.

Probable painful diabetic neuropathy.  Symptoms are predominantly sensory and severely dysfunctioning, with the patient having inability to ambulate independently as well as difficulty with grip and temperature differentiation in his upper extremities.  \n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nREASON FOR NEUROLOGICAL CONSULTATION:  Muscle twitching, clumsiness, progressive pain syndrome, and gait disturbance.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62-year-old African-American male with a significant past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, previous stroke in 2002 with minimal residual right-sided weakness as well as two MIs, status post pacemaker insertion who first presented with numbness in his lower extremities in 2001.  He states that since that time these symptoms have been progressive and now involving his legs above his knees as well as his hands.  More recently, he describes a burning sensation along with numbness.  This has become a particular problem and of all the problems he has he feels that pain is his primary concern.  Over the last six months, he has noticed that he cannot feel hot objects in his hands and that objects slip out of his hands.  He denies any weakness per se, just clumsiness and decreased sensation.  He has also been complaining of brief muscle jerks, which occur in both hands and his shoulders.  This has been a fairly longstanding problem, and again has become more prevalent recently.  He does not have any tremor.  He denies any neck pain.  He walks with the aid of a walker because of unsteadiness with gait.\n\nRecently, he has tried gabapentin, but this was not effective for pain control.  Oxycodone helps somewhat and gives him at least three hours pain relief.  Because of the pain, he has significant problems with fractured sleep.  He states he has not had a good night's sleep in many years.  About six months ago, after an MI and pacemaker insertion, he was transferred to a nursing facility.  At that facility, his insulin was stopped.  Since then he has only been on oral medication for his diabetes.  He denies any back pain, neck pain, change in bowel or bladder function, or specific injury pre-dating these symptoms.\n \n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, arthritis, GERD, and headaches.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Trazodone, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, Prevacid, lisinopril, glipizide, and gabapentin.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Discussed above and documented on the chart.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Discussed above and documented on the chart.  He does not smoke.  He lives in a senior citizens building with daily nursing aids.  He previously was a security guard, but is currently on disability.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Discussed above and documented on the chart.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, blood pressure 150/80, pulse of 80, respiratory rate 22, and weight 360 pounds.  Pain scale 7/10.  A full general and neurological examination was performed on the patient and is documented on the chart.\n\nThe patient is obese with significant ankle edema.\n\nNeurological examination reveals normal cognitive exam and normal cranial nerve examination.  Motor examination reveals mild atrophy in bilateral FDIs, but still has a strong grip.  Individual muscle strength is close to normal with only subtle weakness found in ankle plantar and dorsiflexion.  Tone and bulk are normal.  Sensory examination reveals a severe decrease to all modalities in his lower extremities from just above the knees distally.  He has no vibration sense at his knees.  Similarly, there is decrease to all sensory modalities in his both upper extremities from just above the wrist distally.  The only reflexes I could obtain with trace reflexes in his biceps.  Remaining reflexes were unelicitable.  No Babinski.  The patient walks normally with the aid of a cane.  He has severe sensory ataxia with inability to walk unaided.  Positive Romberg with eyes open and closed.\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:\n1.  Probable painful diabetic neuropathy.  Symptoms are predominantly sensory and severely dysfunctioning, with the patient having inability to ambulate independently as well as difficulty with grip and temperature differentiation in his upper extremities.  He has relative preservation of motor function.  Because these symptoms are progressive and, by report, he came off his insulin, suggesting somewhat mild diabetes, I would like to rule out other causes of progressive neuropathy.\n2.  He has history of myoclonic jerks.  I did not see any on my examination today and I feel that these are benign and probably secondary to his severe insomnia, which he states is secondary to the painful neuropathy.  I would like to rule out other causes such as hepatic encephalopathy.\n \nI have recommended the following:\n1.  EMG/nerve conduction study to assess severity of neuropathy and to characterize neuropathy.\n2.  Blood work, looking for other causes of neuropathy and myoclonus, to include CBC, CMP, TSH, LFT, B12, RPR, ESR, Lyme titer, and HbA1c, and ammonia level.\n3.  Neurontin and oxycodone have not been effective, and I have recommended Cymbalta starting at 30 mg q.d. for five days and then increasing to 60 mg q.d.  Side effect profile of this medication was discussed with the patient.\n4.  I have explained to him that progression of diabetic neuropathy is closely related to diabetic control and I have recommended tight diabetic control.\n5.  I will see him at followup at the EMG.

The patient has a long history of severe and debilitating rheumatoid arthritis for which she has had numerous treatments, but over the past ten years she has been treated with methotrexate quite successfully.  Her dosage has varied somewhere between 20 and 25 mg per week.  About the beginning of this year, her dosage was decreased from 25 mg to 20 mg, but because of the flare of the rheumatoid arthritis, it was increased to 22.5 mg per week.  She has had no problems with methotrexate as far as she knows.  She also took an NSAID about a month ago that was recently continued because of the ulcerations in her mouth.  About two weeks ago, just about the time the stomatitis began she was placed on an antibiotic for suspected upper respiratory infection.  She does not remember the name of the antibiotic.  Although she claims she remembers taking this type of medication in the past without any problems.  She was on that medication three pills a day for three to four days.  She notes no other problems with her skin.  She remembers no allergic reactions to medication.  She has no previous history of fever blisters.  \n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Reveals superficial erosions along the lips particularly the lower lips.  The posterior buccal mucosa along the sides of the tongue and also some superficial erosions along the upper and lower gingiva.  Her posterior pharynx was difficult to visualize, but I saw no erosions on the areas today.  There did however appear to be one small erosion on the soft palate.  Examination of the rest of her skin revealed no areas of dermatitis or blistering.  There were some macular hyperpigmentation on the right arm where she has had a previous burn, plus the deformities from her rheumatoid arthritis on her hands and feet as well as scars on her knees from total joint replacement surgeries.  \n\nIMPRESSION:  Erosive stomatitis probably secondary to methotrexate even though the medication has been used for ten years without any problems.  Methotrexate may produce an erosive stomatitis and enteritis after such a use. The patient also may have an enteritis that at this point may have become more quiescent as she notes that she did have some diarrhea about the time her mouth problem developed. She has had no diarrhea today, however. She has noted no blood in her stools and has had no episodes of nausea or vomiting.  \n\nI am not as familiar with the NSAID causing an erosive stomatitis.  I understand that it can cause gastrointestinal upset, but given the choice between the two, I would think the methotrexate is the most likely etiology for the stomatitis.  \n\nRECOMMENDED THERAPY: I agree with your therapeutic regimen regarding this condition with the use of prednisone and folic acid.  I also agree that the methotrexate must be discontinued in order to produce a resolution of this patients  skin problem. However, in my experience, this stomatitis may take a number of weeks to go away completely if a patient been on methotrexate, for an extended period of time, because the medication is stored within the liver and in fatty tissue.  Topically I have prescribed Lidex gel, which I find works extremely well in stomatitis conditions.  It can be applied t.i.d.  \n\nThank you very much for allowing me to share in the care of this pleasant patient.  I will follow her with you as needed.

The pain is described as crampy in the central part of her abdomen, and is associated with nausea and vomiting during the previous 24 hours. The patient denied passing any stool or gas per rectum for the previous 24 hours. She had been admitted recently to the hospital from December 19 to December 23, 2000, with a three-week history of fevers to 101.8, diaphoresis, anorexia, malaise and skin &quot;lumps&quot;. She described a total of three &quot;lumps&quot;. The first one started as a pin-sized lesion that grew up and then disappeared, the other two didn't resolve. They were described as &quot;erythematous nodular lesions on the extensor surface of the left arm.&quot; A punch biopsy was obtained from these skin lesions, showing deep dermis and subcutaneous adipose tissue that contained &quot;multiple granulomas composed of histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells without caseating necrosis&quot;. However, one granuloma in the deep dermis, showed a hint of central necrosis. Special stains for acid - fast bacilli and fungi were reported as negative. No atypia or malignancy was noted. A CT scan of the chest was obtained on December 19, 2000 and showed numerous masses with spiculated borders bilaterally, predominately in the upper lobes and superior segments of the lower lobes. No cavitary lesions, mediastinal masses or definite hilar adenopathy were reported. The patient underwent bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy which showed fragments of bronchial mucosa and wall with underlying lung parenchyma. Minimal to mild interstitial lymphocytes with a few microfoci of neutrophils were seen. They were also able to appreciate intra-alveolar fibrinous exudates. One of the blood cultures drawn on December 19, 2000 grew Streptococcus mitis.\n\nThe patient was discharged on ethambutol 1200 mg po qd, clarithromycin 500 mg po bid, ampicillin 500 mg po q 6h and fluconazole 200 mg po qd.\n\nPast Medical History:\n\n1.

The patient was treated with intravenous gamma globulin and had some mild improvement in her symptoms.  Her vital capacities were normal during the hospitalization.  Her chest x-ray was negative for any acute process.  She was discharged to rehab from July 12, 2006 to July 20, 2006.  She made some progress in which she notes that her walking is definitely better.  However, she notes that she still has some problems with eye movement and her vision.  This is possibly her main problem.  She also reports tightness and pain in her mid back.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Documented in the clinic note.  The patient has problems with diabetes, double vision, blurry vision, muscle pain, weakness, trouble walking, and headaches about two to three times per week.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1.  Hypertension.\n2.  Diabetes mellitus.\n3.  Stroke involving the right basal ganglion.\n4.  Guillain-Barre syndrome diagnosed in June of 2006.\n5.  Bilateral knee replacements.\n6.  Total abdominal hysterectomy and cholecystectomy.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Multiple family members have diabetes mellitus.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is retired on disability due to her knee replacements.  She does not smoke, drink or use any illicit drugs.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Percocet 5/325 mg 4-6 hours p.r.n., Neurontin 100 mg per day, insulin, Protonix 40 mg per day, Toprol-XL 50 mg q.d., Norvasc 10 mg q.d., glipizide \n10 mg q.d., fluticasone 50 mcg nasal spray, Lasix 20 mg b.i.d., and Zocor 1 mg q.d.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 122/74, heart rate 68, respiratory rate 16, and weight 228 pounds.  Pain scale 5/10.  Please see the written note for details.  General exam is benign other than mild obesity.  On neuro examination, mental status is normal.  Cranial nerves are significant for full visual fields and pupils are equal and reactive.  However, extraocular movements are very limited.  She has some adduction of the left eye and she has minimal upgaze of both eyes, but otherwise the eyes do not move.  Face is symmetric.  Sensation is intact.  Tongue and uvula are in midline.  Palate is elevated symmetrically.  Shoulder shrug is strong.  The patient's muscle exam shows normal bulk and tone throughout.  She has no weakness of the left upper extremity.  In the right upper extremity, she has only about 2/5 strength in the right shoulder, but is otherwise 5/5.  There is no drift or orbit.  Reflexes are absent throughout.  Sensory exam is intact to light touch, pinprick, vibration, and proprioception is normal.  There is no dysmetria.  Gait is somewhat limited possibly by her vision and possibly also by her balance problems.\n\nPERTINENT DATA:  As reviewed previously.\n\nDISCUSSION:  This is a 62-year-old woman with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke who has what sounds like Guillain-Barre syndrome, likely the Miller-Fisher variant.  The patient has shown some improvement with IVIG and continues to show some gradual improvement.  I discussed with the patient the course of disease, which is often weeks to about a month or so of worsening followed by many months of gradual improvement.\n\nI told her that it is possible she may not recover 100%, but that certainly there is still plenty of time for her to have additional recovery over what she has right now.  She is scheduled to see an ophthalmologist.  I think it is reasonable for close followup of her visual symptoms progress.  However, I certainly would not take any corrective measures at this point as I suspect her vision will improve gradually.\n\nI discussed with the patient that with respect to her back pain certainly the Neurontin is relatively at low dose and this could be increased further.  I wanted her to start taking the Neurontin 300 mg per day and then 300 mg b.i.d. after one week.  She will call me in approximately three weeks' time to let me know how she is doing and if needed we will titrate up further.\n\nShe was apparently given some baclofen by her internist and I think this is not unreasonable.  I definitely hope to get her off the Percocet in the future.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1.  Guillain-Barre Miller-Fisher variant.\n2.  Hypertension.\n3.  Diabetes mellitus.\n4.  Stroke.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1.  The patient is to start taking aspirin 162 mg per day.\n2.  Followup with ophthalmology.\n3.  Increase Neurontin to 300 mg per day x 1 week and then 300 mg b.i.d.\n4.  Followup by phone in three to four weeks.\n5.  Followup in this clinic in approximately two months' time.\n6.  Call for any questions or problems.

A lady with dementia, coronary artery disease, prior bypass, reduced LV function, and recurrent admissions for diarrhea and hypotension several times.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nREASON FOR CONSULTATION:  Cardiomyopathy and hypotension.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  I am seeing the patient upon the request of Dr. X.  The patient is very well known to me, an 81-year-old lady with dementia, a native American with coronary artery disease with prior bypass, reduced LV function, recurrent admissions for diarrhea and hypotension several times in November and was admitted yesterday because of having diarrhea with hypotension and acute renal insufficiency secondary to that.  Because of her pre-existing coronary artery disease and cardiomyopathy with EF of about 30%, we were consulted to evaluate the patient.  The patient denies any chest pain or chest pressure.

The patient had a low-grade Pap with suspicious high-grade features.  She underwent colposcopy, which showed a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion with a positive ECC of low-grade.  The patient is very, very nervous about colposcopy and did not want to have repeat biopsies today.  Based on her Pap and her ECC, we will consider LEEP.  Also of note, she presented to emergency room with right lower quadrant pain x 1 week preceded by nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea and worsened over the weekend.  She was seen in the emergency room and had an ultrasound and a CAT scan which were within normal limits.  They ruled out appendicitis as well as an ovarian cyst.  The patient is sexually active, but not currently.  She denies any vaginal discharge, fever, chills, or night sweats and her pain is somewhat improved today, but still there specifically in the right lower quadrant.  She denies any dysuria or blood with urination.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HX:  Significant for asthma, pneumonia, and depression.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HX:  None.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Prozac 20 mg q.d.  She desires to be on the NuvaRing.\n\nALLERGIES:  Lactose intolerance.\n\nSOCIAL HX:  She denies smoking or alcohol or drug use.\n\nPE:  VITALS: Stable.  Weight: 114 lb.  Height: 5 feet 2 inches.  GENERAL: Well-developed, well-nourished female in no apparent distress.  HEENT: Within normal limits. NECK: Supple without thyromegaly.  HEART: Regular rate and rhythm.  LUNGS: Clear to auscultation.  ABDOMEN: Soft and nontender.  There is no rebound or guarding.  No palpable masses and no peritoneal signs.  EXTREMITIES: Within normal limits.  SKIN: Warm and dry.  GU: External genitalia is without lesion.  Vaginal is clean without discharge.  Cervix appears normal; however, a colposcopy was performed using acetic acid, which showed a thick acetowhite ring around the cervical os and extending into the canal.  BIMANUAL: Reveals significant cervical motion tenderness and fundal tenderness.  She had no tenderness in her adnexa.  There are no palpable masses.\n\nA:  Although unlikely based on the patient's exam and pain, I have to consider subclinical pelvic inflammatory disease.  GC and chlamydia was sent and I treated her prophylactically with Rocephin 250 mg and azithromycin 1000 mg.  Repeat biopsies were not performed based on her colposcopy as well as her previous Pap and colposcopy by Dr. A.  A LEEP is a reasonable approach even in this 16-year-old.\n\nP:  We will schedule LEEP in the near future.  Even though she has already been exposed HPV Gardasil would still be beneficial in this patient to help prevent recurrence of low-grade lesions as well as high-grade lesions.  Now, we have her given her first shot.

CT showed edema and slight midline shift.  MRI of the brain shows large inhomogeneous infiltrating right frontotemporal neoplasm surrounding the right middle cerebral artery.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nREASON FOR CONSULTATION:  I was asked by Dr. X to see the patient in regard to his likely recurrent brain tumor.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was admitted for symptoms that sounded like postictal state.  He was initially taken to Hospital.  CT showed edema and slight midline shift, and therefore he was transferred here.  He has been seen by Hospitalists Service.  He has not had a recurrent seizure.  Electroencephalogram shows slowing.  MRI of the brain shows large inhomogeneous infiltrating right frontotemporal neoplasm surrounding the right middle cerebral artery.  There is inhomogeneous uptake consistent with potential necrosis.  He also has had a SPECT image of his brain, consistent with neoplasm, suggesting relatively high-grade neoplasm.  The patient was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 1999.  All details are still not available to us.  He underwent a biopsy by Dr. Y. One of the notes suggested that this was a glioma, likely an oligodendroglioma, pending a second opinion at Clinic.  That is not available on the chart as I dictate.\n\nAfter discussion of treatment issues with radiation therapist and Dr. Z (medical oncologist), the decision was made to treat him primarily with radiation alone.  He tolerated that reasonably well.  His wife says it's been several years since he had a scan.  His behavior had not been changed, until it changed as noted earlier in this summary.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  He has had a lumbar fusion.  I believe he's had heart disease.  Mental status changes are either due to the tumor or other psychiatric problems.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  He is living with his wife, next door to one of his children.  He has been disabled since 2001, due to the back problems.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No headaches or vision issues.  Ongoing heart problems, without complaints.  No weakness, numbness or tingling, except that related to his chronic neck pain.  No history of endocrine problems.  He has nocturia and urinary frequency.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 146/91, pulse 76.  Normal conjunctivae.  Ears, nose, throat normal.  Neck is supple.  Chest clear.  Heart tones normal.  Abdomen soft.  Positive bowel sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  No adenopathy in the neck, supraclavicular or axillary regions.  Neurologically alert.  Cranial nerves are intact.  Strength is 5/5 throughout.\n\nLABORATORY WORK:  White blood count 10.4, hemoglobin 16, platelets not noted.  Sodium 137, calcium 9.1.\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Likely recurrent low-grade tumor, possibly evolved to a higher grade, given the MRI and SPECT findings.  Dr. X's note suggests discussing the situation in the tumor board on Wednesday.  He is stable enough.  The pause in his care would not jeopardize his current status.  It would be helpful to get old films and pathology from Abbott Northwestern.  However, he likely will need a re-biopsy, as he is highly suspicious for recurrent tumor and radiation necrosis.  Optimizing his treatment would probably be helped by knowing his current grade of tumor.

CT scan was performed, which demonstrated no hydronephrosis or upper tract process; however, there was significant thickening of the left and posterior bladder wall.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bladder cancer.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male with a history of gross hematuria.  The patient presented to the emergency room near his hometown on 12/24/2007 for evaluation of this gross hematuria.  CT scan was performed, which demonstrated no hydronephrosis or upper tract process; however, there was significant thickening of the left and posterior bladder wall.  Urology referral was initiated and the patient was sent to be evaluated by Dr. X. He eventually underwent a bladder biopsy on 01/18/08, which demonstrated high-grade transitional cell carcinoma without any muscularis propria in the specimen.  Additionally, the patient underwent workup for a right adrenal lesion, which was noted on the initial CT scan.  This workup involved serum cortisol analysis as well as potassium and aldosterone and ACTH level measurement.  All of this workup was found to be grossly negative.  Secondary to the absence of muscle in the specimen, the patient was taken back to the operating room on 02/27/08 by Dr. X and the tumor was noted to be very large with significant tumor burden as well as possible involvement of the bladder neck.  At that time, the referring urologist determined the tumor to be too large and risky for local resection, and the patient was referred to ABCD Urology for management and diagnosis.  The patient presents today for evaluation by Dr. Y.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes condyloma, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, undiagnosed COPD, peripheral vascular disease, and claudication.  The patient denies coronary artery disease.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Includes bladder biopsy on 01/18/08 without muscularis propria in the high-grade TCC specimen and a gun shot wound in 1984 followed by exploratory laparotomy x2.  The patient denies any bowel resection or GU injury at that time; however, he is unsure.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:\n1.  Metoprolol 100 mg b.i.d.\n2.  Diltiazem 120 mg daily.\n3.  Hydrocodone 10/500 mg p.r.n.\n4.  Pravastatin 40 mg daily.\n5.  Lisinopril 20 mg daily.\n6.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Negative for any GU cancer, stones or other complaints.  The patient states he has one uncle who died of lung cancer.  He denies any other family history.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient smokes approximately 2 packs per day times greater than 40 years.  He does drink occasional alcohol approximately 5 to 6 alcoholic drinks per month.  He denies any drug use.  He is a retired liquor store owner.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nGENERAL:  He is a well-developed, well-nourished Caucasian male, who appears slightly older than stated age.  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature is 96.7, blood pressure is 108/57, pulse is 75, and weight of 193.8 pounds.  HEAD AND NECK:  Normocephalic atraumatic.  LUNGS:  Demonstrate decreased breath sounds globally with small rhonchi in the inferior right lung, which is clear somewhat with cough.  HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.  The liver and spleen are not palpably enlarged.  There is a large midline defect covered by skin, of which the fascia has numerous holes poking through.  These small hernias are of approximately 2 cm in diameter at the largest and are nontender.  GU:  The penis is circumcised and there are no lesions, plaques, masses or deformities.  There is some tenderness to palpation near the meatus where 20-French Foley catheter is in place.  Testes are bilaterally descended and there are no masses or tenderness.  There is bilateral mild atrophy.  Epididymidis are grossly within normal limits bilaterally.  Spermatic cords are grossly within normal limits.  There are no palpable inguinal hernias.  RECTAL:  The prostate is mildly enlarged with a small focal firm area in the midline near the apex.  There is however no other focal nodules.  The prostate is grossly approximately 35 to 40 g and is globally firm.  Rectal sphincter tone is grossly within normal limits and there is stool in the rectal vault.  EXTREMITIES:  Demonstrate no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  There is dark red urine in the Foley bag collection.\n\nLABORATORY EXAM:  Review of laboratory from outside facility demonstrates creatinine of 2.38 with BUN of 42.  Additionally, laboratory exam demonstrates a grossly normal serum cortisol, ACTH, potassium, aldosterone level during lesion workup.  CT scan was reviewed from outside facility, report states there is left kidney atrophy without hydro or stones and there is thickened left bladder wall and posterior margins with a balloon inflated in the prostate at the time of the exam.  There is a 3.1 cm right heterogeneous adrenal nodule and there are no upper tract lesions or stones noted.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Bladder cancer.\n\nPLAN:  The patient will undergo a completion TURBT on 03/20/08 with bilateral retrograde pyelograms at the time of surgery.  Preoperative workup and laboratory as well as paper work were performed in clinic today with Dr. Y. The patient will be scheduled for anesthesia preop.  The patient will have urine culture redrawn from his Foley or penis at the time of preoperative evaluation with anesthesia.  The patient was counseled extensively approximately 45 minutes on the nature of his disease and basic prognostic indicators and need for additional workup and staging.  The patient understands these instructions and also agrees to quit smoking prior to his next visit.  This patient was seen in evaluation with Dr. Y who agrees with the impression and plan.

She sustained a concussion with postconcussive symptoms and syndrome that has resolved. \n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mental status changes after a fall.\n\nHISTORY:  Ms. ABC is a 76-year-old female with Alzheimer's, apparently is normally very talkative, active, independent, but with advanced Alzheimer's.  Apparently, she tripped backwards hitting her head on a wheelchair and, had although no loss consciousness, had altered mental status changes.  She was very confused, incomprehensible speech, and was not responding appropriately.  She was transported here stable, with no significant changes.  She ultimately upon arrival here was unchanged in that she was not responding appropriately.  She would have garbled speech, somewhat inappropriate at times, and unable to follow commands.  No other history was able to be obtained.  All pertinent history is documented within the records.  Physical examination also documented in the records, essentially as above.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  HEENT:  Without any obvious signs of trauma.  Pupils are equal and reactive.  Extraocular movements are difficult to assess with her eyes closed, but she will open to voice.  TMs, canals are normal without any signs of hemotympanum.  Nasal mucosa and oropharynx are normal.\nNECK:  Nontender, full range of motion, was not examined initially, a collar was placed.\nHEART:  Regular.\nLUNGS:  Clear.\nCHEST/BACK/ABDOMEN:  Without trauma.\nSKIN:  With multiple excoriations from scratching and itching.\nNEUROLOGIC:  Otherwise she has good sensation, withdrawals to pain.  When lifting the arm, she will hold them up and draw, let them down slowly.  With movement of the legs, she did straighten them back out slowly.  DTRs were intact and equal bilaterally.  Otherwise, the remainder of the examination was unable to be done because of patient's non-cooperation and mental status change.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  CT scan of the head was negative as was cervical spine.  She has a history of being on Coumadin.  Her INR is 1.92, CBC was with a white count of 3.8, 50% neutrophils, 8% bands.  CMP did note a potassium, which was elevated at 5.9, troponin was normal, mag is 2.5, valproic acid level 24.3.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Ms. ABC is a 76-year-old female with multiple medical problems who has sustained a head injury with mental status changes that on repeat examination now at approximately 1930 hours, has completely resolved.  It is likely she sustained a concussion with postconcussive symptoms and syndrome that has resolved.  At this time, she has some other abnormalities in her lab work and I recommend she be admitted for observation and further investigation.  I have discussed this with her son, he agrees.  Otherwise, she has improved significantly.  The patient was discussed with XYZ, who will admit the patient for further evaluation and treatment.

However, he was doing relatively fine and tolerating the wrist soreness that he had, which is day to day, but it has not gotten much worse until this injury.  Once he lifted the object out of the back of his car and it started to hurt, then he was significantly more affected than he was before, and now pain is more on the ulnar side of his wrist than on the radial side of his wrist.  He is here now for evaluation.\n\nCLINICAL/PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  \nMusculoskeletal:  The patient has point tenderness to palpation along the ulnar styloid ECU ridge with some minor tenderness at the TFC region, as well as the lunotriquetral joint.  There is some minor soreness, but not nearly as sore at the SL ligament with dorsiflexion 30&deg;, palmar flexion 30&deg;, radial deviation 5&deg; and ulnar deviation 0&deg;.  Supination/pronation grossly intact without significant signs of instability.  Negative piano key sign compared to the contralateral side.\nSkin:  No skin breakdown or hyperhidrosis.\nNeurologic:  Negative signs of compressive median nerve neuropathy.\nVascular:  Intact.\n\nRADIOLOGICAL/LABORATORY EXAM:  X-rays, three views of the wrist of good penetrance and quality, reveal scapholunate widening of a slack wrist with a possible ulnar styloid nonunion, with a possible occult distal radius fracture fibrous union.  MRI report reviewed.\n\nEVALUATION/TREATMENT PLAN:  The MRI is consistent with edema and swelling in the ulnar styloid region, which is consistent with the injury pattern that he is claiming and where he is most sore.  He has a chronic problem that needs to potentially be addressed.  Sometimes with these acute on chronic problems, what was tolerated initially may no longer be tolerated by the patient, which we talked about.  Our focus still should be on the initial injury which brought him in at this time.  It is a three-week-old injury.  Given the MRI, we probably have seen on radiographs a fibrous union between that ulnar styloid and the remaining portion of the ulna, which may have been torn or injured, especially consistent with the MRI.  Therefore, I would cast him initially to get that to heal, and then reassess.  All questions were answered, and we will make the treatment plans accordingly.  He will followup in two weeks.  We casted him.

Dog was a German shepherd, it belonged to his brother, and the dog spontaneously attacked him.  He sustained a bite to his right lower leg.  Apparently, according to the patient, the dog is well known and is up-to-date on his shots and they wanted to confirm that.  The dog has given no prior history of any reason to believe he is not a healthy dog.  The patient himself developed a puncture wound with a flap injury.  The patient has a flap wound also below the puncture wound, a V-shaped flap, which is pointing towards the foot.  It appears to be viable.  The wound is open about may be roughly a centimeter in the inside of the flap.  He was seen by his medical primary care physician and was given a tetanus shot and the wound was cleaned and wrapped, and then he was referred to us for further assessment.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for history of pulmonary fibrosis and atrial fibrillation.  He is status post bilateral lung transplant back in 2004 because of the pulmonary fibrosis.\n\nALLERGIES:  There are no known allergies.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Include multiple medications that are significant for his lung transplant including Prograf, CellCept, prednisone, omeprazole, Bactrim which he is on chronically, folic acid, vitamin D, Mag-Ox, Toprol-XL, calcium 500 mg, vitamin B1, Centrum Silver, verapamil, and digoxin.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Consistent with a sister of his has ovarian cancer and his father had liver cancer.  Heart disease in the patient's mother and father, and father also has diabetes.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a non-cigarette smoker.  He has occasional glass of wine.  He is married.  He has one biological child and three stepchildren.  He works for ABCD.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He denies any chest pain.  He does admit to exertional shortness of breath.  He denies any GI or GU problems.  He denies any bleeding disorders.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\nGENERAL:  Presents as a well-developed, well-nourished 50-year-old white male who appears to be in mild distress.\nHEENT:  Unremarkable.\nNECK:  Supple.  There is no mass, adenopathy or bruit.\nCHEST:  Normal excursion.\nLUNGS:  Clear to auscultation and percussion.\nCOR:  Regular.  There is no S3 or S4 gallop.

It appears to be well healed and unremarkable.\nGENITALIA:  Deferred.\nRECTAL:  Deferred.\nEXTREMITIES:  He has about 1+ pitting edema to both legs and they have been present since the surgery.  In the right leg, he has an about midway between the right knee and right ankle on the anterior pretibial area, he has a puncture wound that measures about may be centimeter around that appears to be relatively clean, and just below that about may be 3 cm below, he has a flap traumatic injury that measures about may be 4 cm to the point of the flap.  The wound is spread apart about may be a centimeter all along that area and it is relatively clean.  There was some bleeding when I removed the dressing and we were able to pretty much control that with pressure and some silver nitrate.  There were exposed subcutaneous tissues, but there was no exposed tendons that we could see, etc.  The flap appeared to be viable.\nNEUROLOGIC:  Without focal deficits.  The patient is alert and oriented.\n\nIMPRESSION:  A 50-year-old white male with dog bite to his right leg with a history of pulmonary fibrosis, status post bilateral lung transplant several years ago.  He is on multiple medications and he is on chronic Bactrim.  We are going to also add some fluoroquinolone right now to protect the skin and probably going to obtain an Infectious Disease consult.  We will see him back in the office early next week to reassess his wound.  He is to keep the wound clean with the moist dressing right now.  He may shower several times a day.

I offered Anodyne physical therapy, but she was not interested yet at this point.  I suspect that her peripheral neuropathy may be due to her essential thrombocythemia.  We did send her to lab for a CBC due to her anemia and essential thrombocythemia and she needs sed rate due to her peripheral neuropathy, ferritin due to her anemia, and Hemoccult cards x 3 due to anemia.  She needs a DT immunization.  Recheck with me in about three months.  I refilled her Ambien 5 mg at h.s. for one year.  She may get a flu shot next month.

She does take Zyrtec on a fairly regular basis.  Mom is having some allergy trouble herself right now.  She does not know her colors.  She knows some of her shapes.  She speaks in sentences.  She is not showing much interest in the potty.  She is in the 80th percentile for height and weight, and still over 95th percentile for head circumference.  Mom has no other concerns.\n\nALLERGIES:  Eggs and peanuts.\n\nOBJECTIVE:\nGeneral:  Alert, very talkative little girl.\nHEENT:  TMs clear and mobile.  Eyes:  PERRL.  Fundi benign.  Pharynx clear.

Approximately one day after the dental procedure, he began having nausea, and abdominal pain along with fatigue. The abdominal pain was described as pressure-like and was located in the epigastrium and periumbilical regions. He initially attributed the symptoms to a side effect of the antibiotic he was taking. However, with worsening of his symptoms, he presented to the ER 5 days after dental extraction.\n\nAt that time his vitals were T 99.9 &deg; HR 115 RR 18 BP 182/101. His exam was notable for mild tenderness in the central abdomen. Laboratory evaluation was notable for WBC 15.6, Hgb 13.1, Plt 189, 16% bands, 68% PMNs. Na 127, K4.7, Cl 88, CO2 29, BUN 19, Cr 1.5, Glucose 155, Ca 9.6, alk phos 125, t bili 0.7, ALT 29, nl amylase and lipase. UA with 100 protein, lg blood, 53 RBC, 2 WBC. Plain films done at that time revealed dilation of small bowel loops in mid-abdomen up to 3.5cm in diameter, thought to be most consistent with a paralytic ileus. The patient was discharged home with diagnosis of medication-induced gastroenteritis vs. UTI. He was instructed to stop his current antibiotic but start Levaquin, and he was given Vicodin, and phenergan for symptomatic relief.\n\nOver the next 2 days, the patient began having fevers, non-bloody emesis, diarrhea, and confusion in addition to his persistent nausea, and abdominal pain. On the night of presentation, the patient was found by a cousin in his bathroom lethargic and disoriented. EMS was called and patient was taken to the ER. In the ER, the pt was diaphoretic, unable to answer questions appropriately, hypotensive, and febrile, with some response of bp to multiple IVF boluses (4L). He received acetaminophen, and ceftriaxone 2g IV after blood cultures were obtained and an LP was performed in the ER. He was then admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management.\n\nPast Medical History:\n\nAsthma\n\nAllergic Rhinitis\n\nMedications:\n\nloratadine\n\nbeclomethasone nasal\n\nfluticasone/salmeterol inhaled\n\nMontelukast\n\ncephalexin\n\nhydrocodone\n\nAllergies: PCN, but has tolerated cephalosporins in the past.\n\nSocial History: No tobacco use, occasional EtOH, no known drug use, works as a real estate agent.\n\nFamily History: HTN, father with SLE, uncle with Addison s Disease.\n\nPhysical Exam:\n\nT 102.9 &deg; HR 145 RR 22 BP 99/50 98% on room air, (orthostatics were not performed due to patient s mental status)\n\nI/O: minimal urine output after Foley insertion\n\nGen: lethargic, mild tachypnea\n\nHEENT: no evidence of trauma, sclerae anicteric, pupils are equal round and reactive to light, oropharynx clear, MM dry.\n\nNeck: supple, without increased JVP, lymphadenopathy or bruits.

Acromioclavicular osteoarthritis bilaterally. Lucent lesion in the subchondral bone of the R humeral head, likely a degenerative subchondral cyst.\n\nAXR: Minimal dilation of the small bowel loops in the mid abdomen measuring up to 3cm, no mass lesion or free air visible.\n\nMRI brain pre and post gadolinium: No evidence of hemorrhage, abnormal enhancement, mass lesions, mass effect or edema. The ventricles, sulci, and cisterns are age appropriate in size and configuration. There is no evidence for restricted diffusion. There is mucosal thickening lining the walls of the left maxillary sinus, also containing an air fluid level with two different levels within it, most likely from proteinaceous differences. There is mucosal thickening along the posterior wall of the right maxillary sinus. Mucosal thickening is identified along the walls of the sphenoid sinus, ethmoid sinuses and frontal sinus. Sinusitis with chronic and acute features.\n\nEcho: EF 50%, mild LV concentric hypertrophy, otherwise normal chamber sizes and function\n\nTEE: Normal valves, no thrombi, PFO with R to L shunt, trivial MR, trivial TR\n\nRLE Ultrasound with Dopplers   total deep venous obstruction in distal external iliac, common femoral, profunda femoral, and femoral vein, partial DVT in popliteal and posterior tibial veins, and total DVT greater saphenous vein. No venous obstruction on the L LE. R calf 34cm, R thigh 42 cm, L calf 31cm, L thigh 39cm.\n\nCT Abdomen (initial ER visit): Trace bilateral pleural fluid, findings in liver compatible with diffuse fatty infiltration, 3.5cm non calcified R adrenal mass was noted, along with an edematous L adrenal with no discrete mass. There was retroperitoneal edema around the lower abdominal aorta with perinephric stranding, no stone or obstruction. Moderate fullness of small bowel loops was noted, most consistent with a paralytic ileus.\n\nHospital Course: The patient developed right lower extremity swelling and was diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis. Diagnostic studies were performed.

He decided it would be a good idea to get away from the "bad crowd" and come up and live with his mom.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nSUBJECTIVE:  This patient presents to the office today with his mom for checkup.  He used to live in the city.  He used to go to college down in the city.  He got addicted to drugs.  He decided it would be a good idea to get away from the &quot;bad crowd&quot; and come up and live with his mom.  He has a history of doing heroin.  He was injecting into his vein.  He was seeing a physician in the city.  They were prescribing methadone for some time.  He says that did help.  He was on 10 mg of methadone.  He was on it for three to four months.  He tried to wean down on the methadone a couple of different times, but failed.  He has been intermittently using heroin.  He says one of the big problems is that he lives in a household full of drug users and he could not get away from it.  All that changed now that he is living with his mom.  The last time he did heroin was about seven to eight days ago.  He has not had any methadone in about a week either.  He is coming in today specifically requesting methadone.  He also admits to being depressed.  He is sad a lot and down.  He does not have much energy.  He does not have the enthusiasm.  He denies any suicidal or homicidal ideations at the present time.  I questioned him on the symptoms of bipolar disorder and he does not seem to have those symptoms.  His past medical history is significant for no medical problems.  Surgical history, he voluntarily donated his left kidney.  Family and social history were reviewed per the nursing notes.  His allergies are no known drug allergies.  Medications, he takes no medications regularly.\n\nOBJECTIVE:  His weight is 164 pounds, blood pressure 108/60, pulse 88, respirations 16, and temperature was not taken.  General:  He is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  Psychiatric:  Alert and oriented times 3.  Skin:  I examined his upper extremities.  He showed me his injection sites.  I can see marks, but they seem to be healing up nicely.  I do not see any evidence of cellulitis.  There is no evidence of necrotizing fasciitis.\n\nASSESSMENT:  Substance abuse.\n\nPLAN:  I had a long talk with the patient and his mom.  I am not prescribing him any narcotics or controlled substances.  I am not in the practice of trading one addiction for another.  It has been one week without any sort of drugs at all.  I do not think he needs weaning.  I think right now it is mostly psychological, although there still could be some residual physical addiction.  However, once again I do not believe it to be necessary to prescribe him any sort of controlled substance at the present time.  I do believe that his depression needs to be treated.  I gave him fluoxetine 20 mg one tablet daily.  I discussed the side effects in detail.  I did also warn him that all antidepressant medications carry an increased risk of suicide.  If he should start to feel any of these symptoms, he should call #911 or go to the emergency room immediately.  If he has any problems or side effects, he was also directed to call me here at the office.  After-hours, he can go to the emergency room or call #911.  I am going to see him back in three weeks for the depression.  I gave him the name and phone number of Behavioral Health and I told him to call so that he can get into rehabilitation program or at least a support group.  We are unable to make a referral for him to do that.  He has to call on his own.  He has no insurance.  However, I think fluoxetine is very affordable.  He can get it for $4 per month at Wal-Mart.  His mom is going to keep an eye on him as well.  He is going to be staying there.  It sounds like he is looking for a job.

Dog was a German shepherd, it belonged to his brother, and the dog spontaneously attacked him.  He sustained a bite to his right lower leg.  Apparently, according to the patient, the dog is well known and is up-to-date on his shots and they wanted to confirm that.  The dog has given no prior history of any reason to believe he is not a healthy dog.  The patient himself developed a puncture wound with a flap injury.  The patient has a flap wound also below the puncture wound, a V-shaped flap, which is pointing towards the foot.  It appears to be viable.  The wound is open about may be roughly a centimeter in the inside of the flap.

She says her asthma has been worse over the last three months.  She has been using her inhaler daily.  Her allergies seem to be a little bit worse as well.  Her husband has been hauling corn and this seems to aggravate things.  She has not been taking Allegra daily but when she does take it, it seems to help somewhat.  She has not been taking her Flonase which has helped her in the past.  She also notes that in the past she was on Advair but she got some vaginal irritation with that.\n\nShe had been noticing increasing symptoms of irritability and PMS around her menstrual cycle.  She has been more impatient around that time.  Says otherwise her mood is normal during the rest of the month.  It usually is worse the week before her cycle and improves the day her menstrual cycle starts.  Menses have been regular but somewhat shorter than in the past.  Occasionally she will get some spotting after her cycles.  She denies any hot flashes or night sweats with this.  In reviewing the chart it is noted that she did have 3+ blood with what appeared to be a urinary tract infection previously.  Her urine has not been rechecked.  She recently had lab work and cholesterol drawn for a life insurance application and is going to send me those results when available.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As above.  No fevers, no headaches, no shortness of breath currently.  No chest pain or tightness.  No abdominal pain, no heartburn, no constipation, diarrhea or dysuria.  Occasional stress incontinence.  No muscle or joint pain.  No concerns about her skin.  No polyphagia, polydipsia or polyuria.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for asthma, allergic rhinitis and cervical dysplasia.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She is married.  She is a nonsmoker.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Proventil and Allegra.\n\nALLERGIES:  Sulfa.\n\nOBJECTIVE:\nVital signs:  Her weight is 151 pounds.  Blood pressure is 110/60.  Pulse is 72.  Temperature is 97.1 degrees.  Respirations are 20.\nGeneral:  This is a well-developed, well-nourished 42-year-old white female, alert and oriented in no acute distress.  Affect is appropriate and is pleasant.\nHEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Tympanic membranes are clear.  Conjunctivae are clear.  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.  Nares without turbinate edema.  Oropharynx is nonerythematous.\nNeck:  Supple without lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly, carotid bruit or JVD.\nChest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\nCardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.\nAbdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Normoactive bowel sounds.  No masses or organomegaly to palpation.\nExtremities:  Without cyanosis or edema.\nSkin:  Without abnormalities.\nBreasts:  Normal symmetrical breasts without dimpling or retraction.  No nipple discharge.  No masses or lesions to palpation.  No axillary masses or lymphadenopathy.\nGenitourinary:  Normal external genitalia.  The walls of the vaginal vault are visualized with normal pink rugae with no lesions noted.  Cervix is visualized without lesion.  She has a moderate amount of thick white/yellow vaginal discharge in the vaginal vault.  No cervical motion tenderness.  No adnexal tenderness or fullness.\n\nASSESSMENT/PLAN:\n1.  Asthma.  Seems to be worse than in the past.  She is just using her Proventil inhaler but is using it daily.  We will add Flovent 44 mcg two puffs p.o. b.i.d.  May need to increase the dose.  She did get some vaginal irritation with Advair in the past but she is willing to retry that if it is necessary.  May also need to consider Singulair.  She is to call me if she is not improving.  If her shortness of breath worsens she is to call me or go into the emergency department.  We will plan on following up for reevaluation in one month.\n2.  Allergic rhinitis.  We will plan on restarting Allegra and Flonase daily for the time being.\n3.  Premenstrual dysphoric disorder.  She may have some perimenopausal symptoms.  We will start her on fluoxetine 20 mg one tablet p.o. q.d.\n4.  Hematuria.  Likely this is secondary to urinary tract infection but we will repeat a UA to document clearing.  She does have some frequent dysuria but is not having it currently.\n5.  Cervical dysplasia.  Pap smear is taken.  We will notify the patient of results.  If normal we will go back to yearly Pap smear.  She is scheduled for screening mammogram and instructed on monthly self-breast exam techniques.  Recommend she get 1200 mg of calcium and 400 U of vitamin D a day.

He was unable to swallow.  He complained to his parent.  He was taken to Med Care and did not get any better, and therefore presented this morning to ER, where seen and evaluated by Dr. X and concerned as whether he had an abscess either pharyngeal, palatal, or peritonsillar.  He was noted to have extreme tonsillitis with kissing tonsils, marked exudates especially right side and right palatal cellulitis.  A CT scan at ER did not show abscess.  He has not had airway compromise, but he has had difficulty swallowing.  He may have had a low-grade fever, but nothing marked at home.  His records from Hospital are reviewed as well as the pediatric notes by Dr. X. He did have some equivalent leukocytosis.  He had a negative monospot and negative strep screen.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient takes no medications, has had no illnesses or surgeries and he is generally in good health other than being significantly overweight.  He is a sophomore at High School.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory to this illness.\n\nSURGERIES:  None.\n\nHABITS:  Nonsmoker, nondrinker.  Denies illicit drug use.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\nENT:  The patient other than having dysphagia, the patient denies other associated ENT symptomatology.\nGU:  Denies dysuria.\nOrthopedic:  Denies joint pain, difficulty walking, etc.\nNeuro:  Denies headache, blurry vision, etc.\nEyes:  Says vision is intact.\nLungs:  Denies shortness of breath, cough, etc.\nSkin:  He states he has a rash, which occurred from penicillin that he was given IM yesterday at Covington Med Care.  Mildly itchy.  Mother has penicillin allergy.\nEndocrine:  The patient denies any weight loss, weight gain, skin changes, fatigue, etc, essentially no symptoms of hyper or hypothyroidism.\nPhysical Exam:\nGeneral:  This is a morbidly obese white male adolescent, in no acute disease, alert and oriented x 4.  Voice is normal.  He is handling his secretions.  There is no stridor.\nVital Signs:  See vital signs in nurses notes.\nEars:  TM and EACs are normal.  External, normal.\nNose:  Opening clear.  External nose is normal.\nMouth:  Has bilateral marked exudates, tonsillitis, right greater than left.  Uvula is midline.  Tonsils are touching.  There is some redness of the right palatal area, but is not consistent with peritonsillar abscess.  Tongue is normal.  Dentition intact.  No mucosal lesions other than as noted.\nNeck:  No thyromegaly, masses, or adenopathy except for some small minimally enlarged high jugular nodes.\nChest:  Clear to auscultation.\nHeart:  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.\nAbdomen:  Obese.  Complete exam deferred.\nSkin:  Visualized skin dry and intact, except for rash on his inner thighs and upper legs, which is red maculopapular and consistent with possible allergic reaction.\nNeuro:  Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.  Eyes, pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation, full range.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Marked exudative tonsillitis, non-strep, non-mono, probably mixed anaerobic infection.  No significant prior history of tonsillitis.  Possible rash to PENICILLIN.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:  I concur with IV clindamycin and IV Solu-Medrol as per Dr. X. I anticipate this patient may need several days of IV antibiotics and then be able to switch over to oral.  I do not insist that this patient will need surgical intervention since there is no evidence of abscess.  This one episode of severe tonsillitis does not mean the patient needs tonsillectomy, but if he continues to have significant tonsil problems after this he should be referred for ENT evaluation as an outpatient.  The patient's parents in the room had expressed good understanding, have a chance to ask questions.  At this time, I will see the patient back on an as needed basis.

He states that he has difficulty with both his distance vision and also with fine print at near.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. ABC states that over the last year, he has had increasing difficulty with distance vision particularly when he is driving.  He is also having trouble when he is reading.  He does occasionally wear over-the-counter reading glasses, which do help with his near vision.\n\nPast ocular history is significant for astigmatism for which he wore glasses since he was 18 years old.  However, Mr. ABC mentioned today that he has not worn his glasses for the last few years.\n\nHis past medical history is significant for hypertension, low serum testosterone level, hypercholesterolemia, GERD, depression, actinic keratoses, and a history of Pityrosporum folliculitis.\n\nHis family history is significant for diabetes in both parents.  He states that his mother is seen by Mrs. Goldberg, but he is not aware of her ocular history.  He has no known family history of glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration or hereditary blindness.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Wellbutrin XL 450 mg daily, Ritalin long-acting 60 mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide at an unknown dose, Vytorin at an unknown dose, and aspirin.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\nFINDINGS:  Visual acuity today without correction was 20/20 -2 pinholing to 20/16 in the right eye, and 20/40 +2 pinholing to 20/16 in the left eye.  Near vision unaided was J2 in both eyes.\n\nManifest refraction today following pharmacological dilation was -0.50, +0.50 times 155 in the right eye revealing a vision of 20/16.  Manifest refraction was -1.00, +0.25 times 005 revealing a vision of 20/16 in the left eye.  The add was +2 in both eyes.  Visual fields are full to finger counting in both eyes.\n\nExtraocular movements were within normal limits.  Intraocular pressure by applanation was 16 mmHg in the right eye and 18 mmHg in the left eye measured at 11.30 in the morning.\n\nExamination of the anterior segment was unremarkable in both eyes except for mild nuclear sclerotic opacities in both eyes.\n\nDilated fundus examination of the right eye revealed a sharp and pink optic disc with a healthy rim and cup-to-disc ratio of 0.7; however, there was central excavation of the disc, but no disc hemorrhages were noted.  On examination of the macula, there were drusen scattered temporally.  Examination of the vasculature was normal.  Peripheral retinal examination was entirely normal.\n\nOn funduscopic examination of the left eye, there was a sharp and pink disc with a healthy rim, but with central excavation and a cup-to-disc ratio of 0.6.  Of note, there were no disc hemorrhages.  On examination of the macula, there was scattered tiny drusen centrally and superiorly.  Examination of the vasculature was entirely normal.  Peripheral fundus examination was unremarkable.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n1.  Age-related macular degeneration category three (right greater than sign left).\n2.  Glaucoma suspect based on disc appearance (increased cup-to-disc ratio and disc asymmetry).\n3.  Presbyopia and astigmatism.\n4.  Non-visually significant cataracts bilaterally.\n\nPLANS:\n1.  The above diagnoses and management plans each were discussed with the patient who expressed understanding.\n2.  Commence Ocuvite PreserVision capulets one tablet twice a day by mouth for age-related macular degeneration.\n3.  Humphrey visual field and disc photographs today for baseline documentation in view of glaucoma suspicion.\n4.  Followup in Glaucoma Clinic arranged in 4 months' time with repeat Humphrey visual fields at this time for reevaluation and comparison.\n5.  Follow up with Mrs. Braithwaite in the Comprehensive Eye Service Clinic for undilated refraction.\n6.  We will follow up this gentleman in our clinic in 12 months' time; however, I have asked him to return to us soon should he develop any worsening ocular symptoms in the interim.

She had previously been at outlying hospital and had left AMA after 10 sets of BiPAP use. Here she was able to be kept off BiPAP later and slowly improved her exacerbation of COPD with the assistance of pulmonary. She was thought to have bronchitis as well and was treated with antibiotics. During hospitalization she developed acute lower GI bleed and was transferred to intensive care unit and transfused packed red blood cells. GI was consulted, performed endoscopy, revealing diverticular disease of the sigmoid colon, with this being the suspected cause of hemorrhage. Plavix is being held for at least 10 days. Lovenox held as well. No further signs of bleeding. The patient's respiratory status did slowly improve to baseline. She is discharged and given the above noted medications. Followup with Dr. Pesce, of diagnostic pulmonary, in the outpatient setting. She will also followup with Dr. Pesce, in the outpatient setting.

She gets similar symptoms when she rolls over in bed.  At times, she also feels as though she is going to pass out.  These sensations stop if she just sits in one place or lies down for several minutes.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Recurrent dizziness x1 month.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old African-American female with multiple medical problems including CHF (O2 dependent), atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, possible stroke, multiple joint disease including gout, arthritis, both rheumatoid and DJD, who presents with a complaint of one month of dizziness.  She reports a rotational sensation upon arising from the bed or chair that lasts for several minutes and requires her to sit back down and stay in one place.  She gets similar symptoms when she rolls over in bed.  She is not able to describe what direction she feels like she is spinning.  At times, she also feels as though she is going to pass out.  These sensations stop if she just sits in one place or lies down for several minutes.  She does note that it is worse when she turns to the right and when she turns to the left.  She also complains that she gets similar sensations when she looks up.  She denies any recent fever, chills, earache, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, other change in vision, or recent new headaches.  She also notes occasional tinnitus to her right ear.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1.  CHF (uses portable oxygen).\n2.  Atrial fibrillation.\n3.  Gout.\n4.  Arthritis (DJD/rheumatoid).\n5.  Diabetes mellitus.\n6.  Hypothyroidism.\n7.  Hypertension.\n8.  GERD.\n9.  Possible stroke treated in 2003 at University of Maryland with acute onset of presyncopal sensations, sharp pains in the left side of her head and right-sided hemiparesis and numbness.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She is married.  She does not smoke, use alcohol or use illicit drugs.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Please see medication sheet in the chart.  It includes potassium, Pravachol, Prevacid, Synthroid, Diovan, Amaryl, Vitamin B12, Coreg, Coumadin, furosemide, Actos, aspirin, colchicine, Cipro, Percocet, Ultram (has held the latter two medications for the past two weeks due to concerns of exacerbating dizziness).\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Please see note in chart essentially entirely positive including cardiovascular problems of shortness of breath, PND and palpitations, chronic lack of energy, weight gain, the dizziness for which she presented.  Tinnitus in the right ear.  Diabetes and hypothyroidism.  Chronic nausea.  Chronic severe musculoskeletal pains to all extremities as well as to chest and abdomen and back.  Right-sided numbness as well as complaints of bilateral lower extremity numbness and difficulty walking.  She says her mood is sad and may be depressed and she is also extremely anxious.  She has chronic shortness of breath and coughs easily when has to breathe deeply.  She also endorses poor sleep.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nVITAL SIGNS:  Sitting BP 112/84 with a pulse of 84, standing after two minutes 130/90 with a pulse of 66.  Respiratory rate is 20.  Weight is 257 pounds.  Pain scale is 7.\nGENERAL:  This is a somewhat anxious elderly African-American female who tends to amplify findings on examination.  It is a difficult examination due to the fact that no matter where the patient was touched she would wince in pain and withdraw.  She is obese.\nHEENT:  She is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Conjunctivae and sclerae are clear.  Tympanic membranes were visualized bilaterally.  There is tenderness to palpation of any sinus region.  There are no palpable cervical nodes.\nNECK:  Supple although she complains of pain when rotating her neck.\nCHEST:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\nHEART:  Heart sounds are distant.  There are no carotid bruits.\nEXTREMITIES:  She has 1-2+ pitting edema to the mid shins bilaterally.\n\nNEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION:\nMENTAL STATUS:  She is alert and oriented x3.  Her speech is fluent; however, she is extremely tangential.  She is unable to give a cogent medical history including details of hospitalization one month ago when she was admitted for a gout attack and urinary tract infection and underwent several days of rehabilitation.\nCRANIAL NERVES:  Cranial nerves are intact throughout; specifically there is no nystagmus, her gaze is conjugate, there is no diplopia, visual fields are full to confrontation, pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation, extraocular movements are intact, facial sensation and expression are symmetric, vestibuloocular reflexes are intact, hearing is intact to finger rub bilaterally, palate rises symmetrically, normal cough, shoulder shrug is symmetric which shows easy breakaway give, and tongue protrudes in the midline.\nMOTOR:  This is a limited exam due to easy breakaway gait and pain that appears exaggerated to movement of any extremity.  There is suggestion of some mild right-sided paresis; however, the degree was inconsistent and her phasic strength is estimated at 4-4+ throughout.  Her tone is normal throughout.\nSENSORY:  She appears to have diffuse light tough and pinprick and temperature to the right arm and proximal leg.  She also reports that she is numb in both feet; however, sensation testing of light tough, pinprick and vibration was intact.\nCOORDINATION:  There is no obvious dysmetria.\nGAIT:  She uses a walker to stand up, and several near falls when asked to stand unassisted and can only ambulate with a walker.  There are some mild right lower extremity circumduction present.\nREFLEXES:  Biceps 1, triceps trace, brachioradialis 1, patella and ankle absent.  Toes are equivocal.\nOTHER:  Barany maneuver was attempted; however, when the patient was placed supine she immediately began screaming, &quot;Oh my back, oh my back&quot;, and was unable to complete the maneuver.  Brief inspection of her eyes failed to show any nystagmus at that time.\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  This is a 77-year-old African-American female with multiple medical problems who presents with episodic positionally related dizziness of unclear etiology.  Most certainly there is significant exaggeration of the underlying problem and her neurological examination is compounded by much functional overlay, limiting the interpretation of my findings.  I suspect this is just a mild benign positional vertigo, although I cannot rule out vertebrobasilar compromise.  I agree with symptomatic treatment with Antivert.\n\nWe will schedule her for CT of head, CT angiogram to evaluate for possible brain stroke and vertebrobasilar insufficiency.  In addition, we will attempt to get further objective data by ENG testing.  I will see the patient again after these tests are completed and she has a trial of the Antivert.

During the episode, he felt nauseated and possibly lightheaded.  His wife was present and noted that he looked extremely pale.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transient visual loss lasting five minutes.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a very active and pleasant 82-year-old white male with a past medical history significant for first-degree AV block, status post pacemaker placement, hypothyroidism secondary to hyperthyroidism and irradiation, possible lumbar stenosis.  He reports he experienced a single episode of his vision decreasing &quot;like it was compressed from the top down with a black sheet coming down&quot;.  The episode lasted approximately five minutes and occurred three weeks ago while he was driving a car.  He was able to pull the car over to the side of the road safely.  During the episode, he felt nauseated and possibly lightheaded.  His wife was present and noted that he looked extremely pale and ashen during the episode.  He went to see the Clinic at that time and received a CT scan, carotid Dopplers, echocardiogram, and neurological evaluation, all of which were unremarkable.  It was suggested at that time that he get a CT angiogram since he cannot have an MRI due to his pacemaker.  He has had no further similar events.  He denies any lesions or other visual change, focal weakness or sensory change, headaches, gait change or other neurological problem.\n\nHe also reports that he has been diagnosed with lumbar stenosis based on some mild difficulty arising from a chair for which an outside physician ordered a CT of his L-spine that reportedly showed lumbar stenosis.  The question has arisen as to whether he should have a CT myelogram to further evaluate this process.  He has no back pain or pain of any type, he denies bowel or bladder incontinence or frank lower extremity weakness.  He is extremely active and plays tennis at least three times a week.  He denies recent episodes of unexpected falls.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He only endorses hypothyroidism, the episode of visual loss described above and joint pain.  He also endorses having trouble getting out of a chair, but otherwise his review of systems is negative.  A copy is in his clinic chart.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above.  He has had bilateral knee replacement three years ago and experiences some pain in his knees with this.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  He is retired from the social security administration x 20 years.  He travels a lot and is extremely active.  He does not smoke.  He consumes alcohol socially only.  He does not use illicit drugs.  He is married.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  The patient has recently been started on Plavix by his primary care doctor, was briefly on baby aspirin 81 mg per day since the TIA-like event three weeks ago.  He also takes Proscar 5 mg q.d and Synthroid 0.2 mg q.d.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nVital Signs:  BP 134/80, heart rate 60, respiratory rate 16, and weight 244 pounds.  He denies any pain.\nGeneral:  This is a pleasant white male in no acute distress.\nHEENT:  He is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Conjunctivae and sclerae are clear.  There is no sinus tenderness.\nNeck:  Supple.\nChest:  Clear to auscultation.\nHeart:  There are no bruits present.\nExtremities:  Extremities are warm and dry.  Distal pulses are full.  There is no edema.\n\nNEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION:\nMENTAL STATUS:  He is alert and oriented to person, place and time with good recent and long-term memory.  His language is fluent.  His attention and concentration are good.\nCRANIAL NERVES:  Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.  VFFTC, PERRL, EOMI, facial sensation and expression are symmetric, hearing is decreased on the right (hearing aid), palate rises symmetrically, shoulder shrug is strong, tongue protrudes in the midline.\nMOTOR:  He has normal bulk and tone throughout.  There is no cogwheeling.  There is some minimal weakness at the iliopsoas bilaterally 4+/5 and possibly trace weakness at the quadriceps -5/5.  Otherwise he is 5/5 throughout including hip adductors and abductors.\nSENSORY:  He has decreased sensation to vibration and proprioception to the middle of his feet only, otherwise sensory is intact to light touch, and temperature, pinprick, proprioception and vibration.\nCOORDINATION:  There is no dysmetria or tremor noted.  His Romberg is negative.  Note that he cannot rise from the chair without using his arms.\nGAIT:  Upon arising, he has a normal step, stride, and toe, heel.  He has difficulty with tandem and tends to fall to the left.\nREFLEXES:  2 at biceps, triceps, patella and 1 at ankles.\n\nThe patient provided a CT scan without contrast from his previous hospitalization three weeks ago, which is normal to my inspection.\n\nHe has had full labs for cholesterol and stroke for risk factors although he does not have those available here.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1.  TIA.  The character of his brief episode of visual loss is concerning for compromise of the posterior circulation.  Differential diagnoses include hypoperfusion, stenosis, and dissection.  He is to get a CT angiogram to evaluate the integrity of the cerebrovascular system.  He has recently been started on Paxil by his primary care physician and this should be continued.  Other risk factors need to be evaluated; however, we will wait for the results to be sent from the outside hospital so that we do not have to repeat his prior workup.  The patient and his wife assure me that the workup was complete and that nothing was found at that time.\n2.  Lumbar stenosis.  His symptoms are very mild and consist mainly of some mild proximal upper extremity weakness and very mild gait instability.  In the absence of motor stabilizing symptoms, the patient is not interested in surgical intervention at this time.  Therefore we would defer further evaluation with CT myelogram as he does not want surgery.\n\nPLAN:\n1.  We will get a CT angiogram of the cerebral vessels.\n2.  Continue Plavix.\n3.  Obtain copies of the workup done at the outside hospital.\n4.  We will follow the lumbar stenosis for the time being.  No further workup is planned.

Two years ago, a similar prolonged confusional spell was reported as well.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nREASON FOR REFERRAL:  The patient is a 76-year-old Caucasian gentleman who works full-time as a tax attorney.  He was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X after a recent hospitalization for possible transient ischemic aphasia.  Two years ago, a similar prolonged confusional spell was reported as well.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.\n\nRELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM:  The patient was brought to the Hospital Emergency Department on 09/30/09 after experiencing an episode of confusion for which he has no recall the previous day.  He has no recollection of the event.  The following information is obtained from his medical record.  On 09/29/09, he reportedly went to a five-hour meeting and stated several times &quot;I do not feel well&quot; and looked &quot;glazed.&quot;  He does not remember anything from midmorning until the middle of the night and when his wife came home, she found him in bed at 6 p.m., which is reportedly unusual.  She thought he was warm and had chills.  He later returned to his baseline.  He was seen by Dr. X in the hospital on 09/30/09 and reported to him at that time that he felt that he had returned entirely to baseline.  His neurological exam at that time was unremarkable aside from missing one of three items on recall for the Mini-Mental Status Examination.  Due to mild memory complaints from himself and his wife, he was referred for more extensive neuropsychological testing.  Note that reportedly when his wife found him in bed, he was shaking and feeling nauseated, somewhat clammy and kept saying that he could not remember anything and he was repeating himself, asking the same questions in an agitated way, so she brought him to the emergency room.  The patient had an episode two years ago of transient loss of memory during which he was staring blankly while sitting at his desk at work and the episode lasted approximately two hours.  He was hospitalized at Hospital at that time as well and evaluation included negative EEG, MRI showing mild atrophy, and a neurological consultation, which did not result in a specific diagnosis, but during this episode he was also reportedly nauseous.  He was also reportedly amnestic for this episode.\n\nIn 2004, he had a sense of a funny feeling in his neck and electrodes in his head and had an MRI at that time which showed some small vessel changes.\n\nDuring this interview, the patient reported that other than a coworker noticing a few careless errors in his completion of some documents and his wife reporting some mild memory changes that he had not noticed any significant decline.  He thought that his memory abilities were similar to those of his peers of his same age.  When I asked about this episode, he said he had no recall of it at all and that he &quot;felt fine the whole time.&quot;  He appeared to be somewhat questioning of the validity of reports that he was amnestic and confused at that time.  So, The patient reported some age related &quot;memory lapses&quot; such as going into a room and forgetting why, sometimes putting something down and forgetting where he had put it.  However, he reported that these were entirely within normal expectations and he denied any type of impairment in his ability to continue to work full-time as a tax attorney other than his wife and one coworker, he had not received any feedback from his children or friends of any problems.  He denied any missed appointments, any difficulty scheduling and maintaining appointments.  He does not have to recheck information for errors.  He is able to complete tasks in the same amount of time as he always has.  He reported that he has not made additional errors in tasks that he completed.  He said he does write everything down, but has always done things that way.  He reported that he works in a position that requires a high level of attentiveness and knowledge and that will become obvious very quickly if he was having difficulties or making mistakes.  He did report some age related changes in attention as well, although very mild and he thought these were normal and not more than he would expect for his age.  He remains completely independent in his ADLs.  He denied any difficulty with driving or maintaining any activities that he had always participated in.  He is also able to handle their finances.  He did report significant stress recently particularly in relation to his work environment.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes coronary artery disease, status post CABG in 1991, radical prostate cancer, status post radical prostatectomy, nephrectomy for the same cancer, hypertension, lumbar surgery done twice previously, lumbar stenosis many years ago in the 1960s and 1970s, now followed by Dr. Y with another lumbar surgery scheduled to be done shortly after this evaluation, and hyperlipidemia.  Note that due to back pain, he had been taking Percocet daily prior to his hospitalization.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Celebrex 200 mg, levothyroxine 0.025 mg, Vytorin 10/40 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, Coreg 10 mg, glucosamine with chondroitin, prostate 2.2, aspirin 81 mg, and laxative stimulant or stool softener.  Note that medical records say that he was supposed to be taking Lipitor 40 mg, but it is not clear if he was doing so and also there was no specific reason found for why he was taking the levothyroxine.\n\nOTHER MEDICAL HISTORY:  Surgical history is significant for hernia repair in 2007 as well.  The patient reported drinking an occasional glass of wine approximately two days of the week.  He quit smoking cigarettes 25 to 30 years ago and he was diagnosed with cancer.  He denied any illicit drug use.  Please add that his prostatectomy was done in 1993 and nephrectomy in 1983 for carcinoma.  He also had right carpal tunnel surgery in 2005 and has cholelithiasis.  Upon discharge from the hospital, the patient's sleep deprived EEG was recommended.\n\nMRI completed on 09/30/09 showed &quot;mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy with no significant interval change from a prior study dated June 15, 2007.  No evidence of acute intracranial processes identified.  CT scan was also unremarkable showing only mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy.  EEG was negative.  Deferential diagnosis was transient global amnesia versus possible seizure disorder.  Note that he also reportedly has some hearing changes, but has not followed up with an evaluation for hearing aid.\n\nFAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: Reportedly significant for TIAs in his mother, although the patient did not report this during our evaluation and so that she had no memory problems or dementia when she passed away of old age at the age of 85.  In addition, his father had a history of heart disease and passed away at the age of 75.  He has one sister with diabetes and thought his mom might have had diabetes as well.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient obtained a law degree from the University of Baltimore.  He did not complete his undergraduate degree from the University of Maryland because he was able to transfer his credits in order to attend law school at that time.  He reported that he did not obtain very good grades until he reached law school, at which point he graduated in the top 10 of his class and had no problem passing the Bar.  He thought that effort and motivation were important to his success in his school and he had not felt very motivated previously.  He reported that he repeated math classes &quot;every year of school&quot; and attended summer school every year due to that.  He has worked as a tax attorney for the past 48 years and reported having a thriving practice with clients all across the country.  He served also in the U.S.  Coast Guard between 1951 and 1953.  He has been married for the past 36 years to his wife, Linda, who is a homemaker.  They have four children and he reported having good relationship with them.  He described being very active.  He goes for dancing four to five times a week, swims daily, plays golf regularly and spends significant amounts of time socializing with friends.\n\nPSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:  The patient denied any history of psychological or psychiatric treatment.  He reported that some stressors occasionally contribute to mildly low mood at this time, but that these are transient.\n\nTASKS ADMINISTERED:\nClinical Interview\nAdult History Questionnaire\nWechsler admin of Adult Reading (WTAR)\nMini Mental Status Exam (MMSE)\nCognistat Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination\nRepeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; Form XX)\nMattis Dementia Rating Scale, 2nd Edition (DRS-2)\nNeuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB)\nWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III)\nWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV)\nWechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI)\nTest of Variables of Attention (TOVA)\nAuditory Consonant Trigrams (ACT)\nPaced Auditory Serial Addition admin (PASAT)\nRuff 2 & 7 Selective Attention admin\nSymbol Digit Modalities admin (SDMT)\nMultilingual Aphasia Examination, Second Edition (MAE-II)\n Token admin\n Sentence Repetition\n Visual Naming\n Controlled Oral Word Association\n Spelling admin\n Aural Comprehension\n Reading Comprehension\nBoston Naming admin, Second Edition (BNT-2)\nAnimal Naming admin\nControlled Oral Word Association admin (COWAT:  F-A-S)\nThe Beery-Buktenica Developmental admin of Visual-Motor Integration (VMI)\nThe Beery-Buktenica Developmental admin of Motor Coordination\nThe Beery-Buktenica Developmental admin of Visual Perception\nHooper Visual Organization admin (VOT)\nJudgment of Line Orientation (JOLO)\nRey Complex Figure admin (RCFT)\nWechsler Memory Scale, Third Edition (WMS-III)\nWechsler Memory Scale, Fourth Edition (WMS-IV)\nCalifornia Verbal Learning admin, Second Edition (CVLT-II)\nRey Auditory-Verbal Learning admin (RAVLT)\nDelis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS)\n Trail Making admin\n Verbal Fluency (Letter & Category)\n Design Fluency\n Color-Word Interference admin\n Tower\nWisconsin Card Sorting admin (WCST)\nStroop Color-Word admin\nColor Trails\nTrail Making admin A & B\nWide Range Achievement admin, Fourth Edition (WRAT-IV)\nWoodcock Johnson Tests of Achievement, Third Edition (WJ-III)\nNelson-Denny Reading admin\nGrooved Pegboard\nPurdue Pegboard\nFinger Tapping admin\nBeck Depression Inventory (BDI)\nMood Assessment Scale (MAS)\nState-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)\nMinnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, Second Edition (MMPI-2)\nMillon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory, Third Edition (MCMI-III)\nMillon Behavioral Medicine Diagnostic (MBMD)\nBehavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF)\nAdaptive Behavior Assessment System, Second Edition (ABAS-II)\n\nBEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS:  His wife arrived unaccompanied and on time for his appointment.  He was well-dressed and groomed and appeared younger than his stated age.  He ambulated independently and no gross psychomotor abnormalities were apparent.  Eye contact was good.  Speech was normal with respects to rate, rhythm, and paucity.  Receptive language abilities appeared to be good as he was able to appropriately respond to the examiner's questions and instructions.  Thought processes were linear and goal-directed and no thought disturbances were noted.  Mood appeared to be euthymic.  Affect was appropriate and full range.\n\nVision and hearing appeared to be appropriate for the evaluation, although as noted, he apparently has some mild decline in his hearing that has not been addressed or evaluated.  Overall, he was very friendly and rapport was very easily developed.\n\nHe appeared to put full effort into all tasks and thus these results are thought to be an accurate reflection of his current cognitive functioning.  Premorbid intellectual functioning; based on a word reading admin, premorbid intellectual functioning was estimated to fall in the superior range.  He was notably impulse throughout the evaluation, as he would often try to begin a task before the examiner had completed providing instructions.\n\nCOGNITIVE FUNCTIONING:  The patient was performed within the high average range on a measure of gross cognitive functioning assessing his performance across several domains including attention, visuospatial construction, memory conceptualization and initiation or perseveration.  He performed within normal limits on all these domains.\n\nATTENTION:  Passive and active auditory attention fell in the average range as he was able to accurately repeat six digits in forward sequence and five digits in backward sequence.  Visual working memory was in the high average range.  On a admin of sustained attention for visual stimuli, he demonstrated high rate of accuracy despite the fact that there was mild decreases in consistency of his responses as the task progressed and at different interstimulus intervals.  Overall, however, these results appear to be well within normal limits.  Thus taken together the patient's auditory and nonverbal attentional abilities, all fell within normal limits and did not suggest significant decline from premorbid levels.\n\nLANGUAGE:  Confrontation naming was strong and in the high average range.  He demonstrated good comprehension for verbal instructions.  He made a few very mild errors on a sentence repetition task, which may have been due to mild hearing problems.  The errors did not appear to be of clinical significance.  Rapid verbal retrieval fell in the average range for both phonemic and semantic cues well within broad normal limits.  This result may have represented a mild weakness relative to his estimated premorbid functioning.  Thus taken together, language abilities generally fell within the expected range, although mild weaknesses were seen in verbal fluency.\n\nVISUOSPATIAL PERCEPTION AND CONSTRUCTION:  Visuospatial perception appeared to be within broad normal limits, although his construction and copy of visual figures was quite sloppy and imprecise.\n\nLEARNING & MEMORY SKILLS:\n\nVERBAL LEARNING AND MEMORY:  On a contextual memory task (i.e. stories), the patient performed within the average range immediately following story presentation, as well as following a delay.  His recognition of story details was in the low average range.  When given a large amount of seemingly unorganized information (i.e.  16-item list), The patient's initial ability to recall five-items immediately following presentation was in the average range.  He benefited significantly from repetition as he was able to recall 10 items following the second presentation and following a fifth presentation, he was able to successfully recall 13 of the 16 items (superior).  When immediately provided with a second list of 16-items, he was only able to recall three items immediately following presentation (low average).  His recall of the first list following short and long delays was in the average range.  Delayed recognition was also average.\n\nOf note, during his recalls, he made a large number of repetition errors suggesting some difficulty with self-monitoring of his responses.  He also did not recognize and apply any organizational strategy.  Taken together, The patient's performance across measures of verbal learning and memory fell within broad normal limits relative to others of same age.  However, given his very high level of premorbid functioning, his performance suggested some mild weaknesses in encoding and retrieval that he is generally able to overcome with repetition of information.\n\nHe also appeared to have some difficulty organizing and monitoring his responses and difficulty with learning multiple simultaneous streams of information.\n\nNON-VERBAL LEARNING AND MEMORY:  The patient's immediate recall of visual designs was in the borderline range.  However, he retained most of the information that he initially learned following a delay and his performance fell in the low average range.  Recognition was average.  Taken together, these results again suggest that he had difficulties with encoding and retrieval of nonverbal information.  However, he was able to retain most of the reduced amount of information that he had initially learned.\n\nEXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING:  As mentioned, initiation and verbal fluency fell in the average range.  It is mildly weaker than expected given The patient's strong premorbid functioning.  He was also noted to make a number of repetition errors on this task.  Cognitive set shifting was generally within expected limits and in the average to high average range.  He was able to successfully inhibit a prepotent response.  On a task assessing cognitive flexibility inductive reasoning and the ability to use feedback in order to correct an ongoing response, The patient was noted to be quite impulsive and had difficulty conceptualizing alternate means to apply strategies in order to determine the correct answer and appeared to be somewhat distracted by nonessential information.  As mentioned above, he had a number of repetitions and difficulty organizing information meaningfully on memory tasks.  Taken together, these results suggest mild weaknesses in aspects of frontal lobe functioning.\n\nMOTOR FUNCTIONING:  The patient performed in the average range with both of his right dominant hand and left nondominant hand on a speeded fine motor coordination task.\n\nEMOTIONAL FUNCTIONING:  On an affective screening measure, the patient endorsed only four items, which suggested that he was bothered by thoughts he could not get out of his head, often felt helpless, felt downhearted and blue and that his mind was not as clear as it used to be.  Overall, these results fell within normal limits and suggest that he is not currently experiencing a clinical level of depressive symptoms.\n\nSUMMARY & IMPRESSIONS:  The patient is a 76-year-old gentleman who was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation due to possible changes in memory.  He has a history of two episodes of confusion and amnesia, the most recent of which occurred in September 2009 with differential diagnosis including seizure disorder versus transient global amnesia.  On this comprehensive evaluation, the patient demonstrated mild weaknesses relative to his very high level of premorbid functioning on tasks assessing memory and executive functioning.

The patient presents to the emergency room after awakening at 2:30 a.m. this morning with trouble swallowing, trouble breathing, and left-sided numbness and weakness. \n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Cerebrovascular accident (CVA).\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old gentleman with a significant past medical history for nasopharyngeal cancer status post radiation therapy to his pharynx and neck in 1991 who presents to the emergency room after awakening at 2:30 a.m. this morning with trouble swallowing, trouble breathing, and left-sided numbness and weakness.  This occurred at 2:30 a.m.  His wife said that he had trouble speaking as well, but gradually the symptoms resolved but he was still complaining of a headache and at that point, he was brought to the emergency room.  He arrived at the emergency room here via private ambulance at 6:30 a.m. in the morning.  Upon initial evaluation, he did have some left-sided weakness and was complaining of a headache.  He underwent workup including a CT, which was negative and his symptoms slowly began to resolve.  He was initially admitted, placed on Plavix and aspirin.  However a few hours later, his symptoms returned and he had increasing weakness of his left arm and left leg as well as slurred speech.  Repeat CT scan again done reportedly was negative and he was subsequently heparinized and admitted.  He also underwent an echo, carotid ultrasound, and lab work in the emergency room.  Wife is at the bedside and denies he had any other symptoms previous to this.  He denied any chest pain or palpitations.  She does report that he is on a Z-Pak, got a cortisone shot, and some decongestant from Dr. ABC on Saturday because of congestion and that had gotten better.\n\nALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:\n1.

Mother is obese, but otherwise negative history.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He reports he was in his usual state of health up until he awoke this morning.  He does states that yesterday his son cleaned the walk area with some ether and since then he has not quite been feeling right.  He is a right-handed male and normally wears glasses.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nVITAL SIGNS:  Stable.  His blood pressure was 156/97 in the emergency room, pulse is 73, respiratory rate 20, and saturation is 99%.\nGENERAL:  He is alert, pleasant, and in no acute distress at this time.  He answers questions appropriately.\nHEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  Sclerae are clear.  TMs clear.  Oropharynx is clear.\nNECK:  Supple with full range of motion.

It has been spiking ever since and she has had left sacroiliac type hip pain.  She does have degenerative disk disease of her lumbar spine but no hip pathology.  She has swollen inguinal nodes bilaterally.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76-year-old female that was admitted with fever, chills, and left pelvic pain.  The patient was well visiting in ABC, with her daughter that evening.  She had pain in her left posterior pelvic and low back region.  They came back to XYZ the following day.  By the time they got here, she was in severe pain and had fever.  They came straight to the emergency room.  She was admitted.  She had temperature of 104 degrees F.  It has been spiking ever since and she has had left sacroiliac type hip pain.  Multiple blood studies have been done including cultures, febrile agglutinins, etc.  She has had run a higher blood glucose to the normal and she has been on sliding scale insulin.  She was not known previously to be a diabetic.  All x-rays have not been helpful as far as to determine the etiology of her discomfort.  MRIs of the lumbar spine and the pelvis and both thighs have been unremarkable for any inflammatory process.  She does have degenerative disk disease of her lumbar spine but no hip pathology.  She has swollen inguinal nodes bilaterally.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She was not known to be a diabetic until this admission.  She had been hypertensive.  She has been on medications and has been controlled.  She has not had hyperlipidemia.  She has had no thyroid problems.  There has been no asthma, bronchitis, TB, emphysema or pneumonia.  No tuberculosis.  She has had no breast tumors.  She has had no chest pain or cardiac problems.  She has had gallbladder surgery.  She has not had any gastritis or ulcers.  She has had no kidney disease.  She has had a hysterectomy.  She has had 9 pregnancies and 8 living children.  She had A&P repair.  She had a sacral abscess after a spinal.  It sounds to me like she had a pilonidal cyst, which took about 3 operations to heal.  There have been fractures and no significant arthritis.  She has been quite active at her ranch in Mexico.  She raises goats and cattle.  She drives a tractor and in short, has been very active.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is a short female, alert.  She is shivering.  She has ice in her axilla and behind her neck.  She is febrile to 101 degrees F. She is alert.  Her complaint is that of hip pain in the posterior sacroiliac joint area.  She moves both her upper extremities well.  She can move her right leg well.  She actually can move her left hip and knee without much discomfort but the pain radiates from her sacroiliac joint.  She cannot stand, sit or turn without severe pain.  She has normal knee reflexes.  No ankle reflexes.  She has bounding tibial pulses.  No sensory deficit.  She says she knows when she has to void.  She has a healed scar in the upper sacral region.  There is some bruising around the buttocks but the daughter says that is from her being in bed lying on her back.\n\nPLAN:  My plan is to do a triple-phase bone scan.  I am suspecting an infection possibly in the left sacroiliac joint.  It is probably some type of bacterium, the etiology of which is undetermined.  She has had a normal white count despite her fever.  There has been a history of brucellosis in the past, but her titers at this time are negative.  Continue medication which included antibiotics and also the Motrin and Darvocet.

I obtained her history from company medical records and performed an examination.  She is a 38-year-old laborer who states that she was injured on April 26, 2006, which according to the FROI (the injury occurred over a period of time from performing normal job processes such as putting bumpers on cars, gas caps and doors on cars).  She denies having any symptoms prior to the accident April 26, 2006.  She is right handed.  She used a tennis elbow brace, hand exercises, physical therapy, and Vicodin.  She received treatment from Dr. X and also Dr. Y\n\nDIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:  June 27, 2006, EMG and nerve conduction velocity right upper extremity showed a moderate right carpal tunnel syndrome.  No evidence of a right cervical radiculopathy or ulnar neuropathy at the wrist or elbow.  January 29, 2007, EMG right upper extremity was normal and there was a normal nerve conduction velocity.  At the time of the examination, she complained of a constant pain in the olecranon and distal triceps with tingling in the right long, ring and small fingers, and night pain.  The pain was accentuated by gripping or opening the jar.  She is taking four Aleve a day and currently does not have any other treatment.\n\nRECORDS REVIEWED:  Injury and illness incident report, US Healthworks records; Z physician review; Y office notes; X office notes who noted that on examination of the right elbow that the ulnar nerve subluxed with flexion and extension of the elbow.\n\nEXAMINATION:  Examination of her right elbow revealed no measurable atrophy of the upper arm.  She was markedly tender over the medial epicondyle, but also the olecranon and distal process and she was exquisitely tender over the ulnar nerve.  I did not detect subluxation of the ulnar nerve with flexion and extension.  With this, she was extremely tender in this area.  There is no instability of the elbow.  Range of motion was 0 to 145 degrees, flexion 90 degrees of pronation and supination.  The elbow flexion admin was positive.  There is normal motor power in the elbow and also on the right hand, specifically in the ulnar intrinsics.  There was diminished sensation on the right ring and small fingers, specifically the ulnar side of the ring finger of the entire small finger.  There was no wasting of the intrinsics.  No clawing of the hand.  Examination of the right wrist revealed extension 45 degrees, flexion 45 degrees, radial deviation 15 degrees, and ulnar deviation 35 degrees.  She was tender over the dorsum of the hand over the ulnar head and the volar aspect of the wrist.  Wrist flexion causes paresthesias on the right ring and small fingers.  Grasp was weak.  There was no sign of causalgia, but no measurable atrophy of the forearm.  No reflex changes.\n\nQUESTION:  Ms. Xxxxx has filed an application of additional allowance of right cubital tunnel syndrome.  Based on the current objective findings, mechanism of injury, medical records or diagnostic studies, does the medical evidence support the existence of the requested condition?\n\nANSWER:  Yes.  She has a positive elbow flexion admin and she is markedly tender over the ulnar nerve at the elbow and also has diminished sensation in the ulnar nerve distribution, specifically in the entire right small finger and the ulnar half of the ring finger.  I did not find the subluxation of the ulnar nerve with flexion and extension with Dr. X did previously find on his examination.\n\nQUESTION:  If you find these conditions exist, are they a direct and proximate result of April 26, 2006, injury?\n\nANSWER:  Yes.  Repeated flexion and extension would irritate the ulnar nerve particularly if it was subluxing which it could very well have which Dr. X objectively identified on his examination.  Therefore, I believe it is a direct and proximate result of April 26, 2006, injury.\n\nQUESTION:  Do you find that Ms. Xxxxx's injury or disability is caused by natural deterioration of tissue, organ or part of the body?\n\nANSWER:  No.\n\nQUESTION:  In addition, if you find that the condition exists, are there non-occupational activities or intervening injuries that could have contributed to Ms. Xxxxx's condition?\n\nANSWER:  It is possible that direct injury to the ulnar nerve at the elbow could cause this syndrome; however, there is no history of this and the records do not indicate an injury of this type.\n\nQUESTION:    Should the claim be amended to allow for right cubital tunnel syndrome by way of aggravation or flow-through?\n\nANSWER:  Please see the discussion above.  I believe that she does have right cubital tunnel syndrome as a result of the injury of April 26, 2006, and not by way of aggravation or flow-through.\n\nQUESTION:  Based on the current objective findings, documented objective findings and allowed conditions in your medical opinion, has Ms. Xxxxx reached maximum medical improvement (MMI)?  MMI means the condition has stabilized and there is no reasonable expectation or any fundamental, functional, or physiologic changes in the condition despite continued medical treatment and/or rehabilitation.\n\nANSWER:  No.  I do not believe she has reached maximum medical improvement.  There are several things, which could be done.  She could be given medications such as gabapentin or Lyrica, which might help to resolve this condition.  She also might receive injections of hydrocortisone into the medial epicondyle, which might help her as well.\n\nQUESTION:    If Ms. Xxxxx not reached MMI, based on a reasonable degree of medical certainty, when would you expect her to reach that point?\n\nANSWER:  She should have the above treatment that I mentioned.  If she continues to be symptomatic with the above conservative treatment to be a failure, she might require surgery on the medial epicondyle and also on the ulnar nerve.\n\nQUESTION:    Based on the allowed conditions, has treatment to date been medically necessary and appropriate?\n\nANSWER:  Yes.\n\nQUESTION:  Is the current treatment for the allowed conditions?\n\nANSWER:  Yes.\n\nQUESTION:   Is further medical treatment needed for the allowed conditions?\n\nANSWER:  Yes.  See answer to question #2 and #2A.  I think she does need additional conservative treatment and a cortisone injection in the medial epicondyle, gabapentin or Lyrica for the ulnar nerve symptoms.  If this fails, she may even need ulnar nerve at the elbow and also on the medial epicondyle.\n\nQUESTION:    Based on the current objective findings and allowed conditions, can Ms. Xxxxx return to work with or without restrictions?\n\nANSWER:  She can return to work with the following restrictions.  No repetitive use of the right elbow or right hand.\n\nQUESTION:  If the restrictions exist, should they be permanent?\n\nANSWER:  Rather it should be temporary and she should be reevaluated in 90 days.\n\nQUESTION:  Based on the current objective findings, the allowed conditions/ICD codes, and the most recent Edition of the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of the Permanent Impairment, has Ms. Xxxxx sustained a percentage of permanent partial impairment?  If so, please present that percentage in terms of a whole person.\n\nANSWER:  Using the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment Fifth Edition, examination of the right wrist with extension 45 degrees, this equates to 3% impairment of the upper extremity.  Flexion of 45 degrees equals 2% impairment of the upper extremity.  Radial deviation of 15 degrees equals 1% of impairment.  Then using the combined values on page 604, 3 + 2 equals 5, 5 + 1 equals 6% impairment of the right wrist.  Evaluating the right elbow with flexion of 145 degrees equates to 0% impairment of the upper extremity; extension is 0, this is 0% impairment of the upper extremity; with supination of 90 degrees, 0% impairment; pronation 90 degrees, 0% impairment using Table 16-34, page 472.  As far as the wrist is concerned, Figure 16-28, page 467 was used.  For the sensory deficit, the right upper extremities specifically the __________ small finger using Table 16-15, page 492, there is 7% impairment of the upper extremity due to sensory deficit and pain of the right ulnar nerve.  Then using the combined values with 7% impairment of the ulnar nerve involving the ring and small fingers and 6% impairment of the wrist, 6 + 7 using the combined values of page 604 equals 13% impairment.  Then using Table 16-3, page 439, 13% impairment of the right upper extremity equals 8% WPI.

I was doing okay when I stopped my medications in April for a few weeks, but then I got depressed again.  I started lithium three weeks ago.&quot;\n\nHPI:  The patient is a 45-year-old married white female without children currently working as a billing analyst for Northwest Natural.  The patient has had one psychiatric hospitalization for seven days in April of 1999.  The patient now presents with recurrent depressive symptoms for approximately four months.  The patient states that she has decreased energy, suicidal ideation, suicide plan, feelings of guilt, feelings of extreme anger, psychomotor agitation, and increased appetite.  The patient states her sleep is normal and her ability to concentrate is normal.  The patient states that last night she had an argument with her husband in which he threaten to divorce her.  The patient went into the rest room, tried to find a razor blade, could not find one but instead found a scissor and cut her arm moderately with some moderate depth.  She felt better after doing so and put a bandage over the wound and did not report to her husband or anybody else what she had done.  The patient reports that she has had increased tension with her husband as of recent.  She notes that approximately a week ago she struck her husband several times.  She states that he has never hit her but instead pushed her back after she was hitting him.  She reports no history of abuse in the past.  The patient identifies recent stressors as having ongoing conflict at work with her administrator with them &quot;cracking down on me.&quot; The patient also notes that her longstanding therapy will be temporarily interrupted by the therapist having a child.  She states that her recent depression seems to coincide with her growing knowledge that her therapist was pregnant.  The patient states that she has a tremendous amount of anger towards her therapist for discontinuing or postponing treatment.  She states that she feels &quot;abandoned.&quot; The patient notes that it does raise issues with her past, where she had a child at the age of 17 who she gave away for adoption and a second child that she was pregnant by the age of 42 that she aborted at the request of her husband.  The patient states she saw her therapist most recently last Friday.  She sees the therapy weekly and indicates the therapy helps, although she is unable to specify how.  When asked for specifics of what she has learned from the therapy, the patient was unable to reply.  It appears that she is very concrete and has difficulty with symbolization and abstractions and self-observation.  The patient reports that at her last visit her therapist was concerned that she may be suicidal and was considering hospitalization.  The patient, at that point, stated that she would be safe through Monday despite having made a gesture last night.  At present, the patient's mood is reactive and for much of the session she appears angry and irritated with me but at the end of the session, after I have given her my assessment, she appears calmed and not depressed.

The patient notes that suicidality and depression seems to often arise around disputes with her husband and/or feelings of abandonment.  The patient indicates some satisfaction when she is called on her behavior &quot;I need to answer for my actions.&quot; The patient gives a substantial history of alcohol abuse lasting up to about five years ago when she was hospitalized.  Most typically, the patient will drink at least a bottle of wine per day.

Janet Green is her primary physician.  The patient also has had herniated disc in the neck and a sinus inflammation, both of which were treated surgically.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  The patient currently is taking Synthroid 75 mcg per day and lithium 1200 mg p.o. q.d. The patient started the lithium approximately three weeks ago and has not had a recent lithium level or kidney function admin.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\nSUBSTANCE HISTORY:  The patient has been sober for five years.  She drank one bottle of wine per day as per HPI.  History of drinking for approximately 25 years.  The patient does not currently have a sponsor.

Her brother has been incarcerated numerous times for assaults and has difficulty with anger and rage.  He made a suicide attempt at age 17.  The patient's father is a machinist who she describes as somewhat narcissistic and with alcohol abuse problem.  He also has arthritis.  The patient's mother is arthritic.  She states that her mother stopped working at middle age after being laid off and appears somewhat reclusive.\n\nEDUCATIONAL HISTORY:  The patient was educated through high school and has two years of Night College.  The patient states that she grew up and was raised in Portland but notes her childhood was primarily lonely.  She states she was unliked and unpopular child because she was &quot;shy&quot; and &quot;not smart enough.&quot; The patient denies having secrets.  The patient reports that this is her second marriage, which has lasted two years.  Her first marriage lasted I believe it was five years.  The patient also had a relationship in recovery for four years, which ended after they went &quot;different directions.&quot;\n\nMSE:  The patient is middle-aged white female, dressed in a red sweater with a white shirt, full patterned skirt, and open sandals.  The patient is suspicious and somewhat confrontative early in the session.  She asked me regarding my cancellation policy, why I require seven days and not 24 hours.  The patient also is irritated with paper required of her.  Psychomotor is increased slightly.  The patient makes strong eye contact.  Speech is normal rate, rhythm, and volume.  Mood is &quot;irritated.&quot; Affect is irritated, angry, demanding, attempting to wrest control from me, depressed, frustrated.  Thought is directed.  Content is nondelusional.  There are no auditory and no visual hallucinations.  The patient has no homicidal ideation.  The patient does endorse suicidal ideations.  Regarding plan, the patient notes that cutting herself hurts too much therefore she would like to take some benzodiazepines or barbiturates but has access to none.  The patient states that she will not try to hurt herself currently and that she poses no risk at present.  The patient notes that she does not want to go to the hospital at present.  The patient is alert and oriented x 3.  Recall is three for three at five minutes.  Proverbs are concrete.  She has fair impulse control, poor judgment, and poor insight.\n\nFORMULATION:  The patient is a 45-year-old married white female with no children now presenting with recurrent depressive symptoms and active suicidal ideation and planning.  The patient reports longstanding depressive symptoms that were subthreshold punctuated by periods of more severe depression.  The patient also reports some up periods, which do not meet most criteria for a bipolar disorder or manic states.  The patient notes that current depression started with approximately the same time that she became aware that her therapist was pregnant.  She notes that the current depression is atypical in that it is primarily anger based and she does not have the typical hypersomnia that she gets.  The patient reports being unable to express anger to her therapist and being unable to discuss her feeling regarding the pregnancy.  The patient also states that she feels abandoned with the upcoming discontinuation of treatment while the therapist is giving birth and thereafter.  Symptoms are consistent with a longstanding dysthymia and reoccurring depression.  In addition, diagnosis is highly complicated by presence of a strong personality disorder component, most likely borderline personality disorder.  This latter diagnosis seems to be the most active at this time with the patient acutely reacting to perceived therapist's absence and departure.  This is exacerbated by instability in the patient's marital life.\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nAxis I:  Dysthymia.  Major depression, moderate severity, recurrent, with partial remission.\nAxis II:  Borderline personality disorder.\nAxis III:  Hypothyroidism and cervical disc herniation and sinus surgery.\nAxis IV:  Medical access.  Marital discord.\nAxis V:  A GAF of 30.\n\nPLAN:  The patient is unlikely to have bipolar disorder.  We will recommend the patient's thyroid be rechecked to ensure she is currently euthymic.  We would recommend continued weekly or twice weekly insight oriented psychotherapy with aggressive exploration of the patient's reaction to her therapist's departure.  We would also recommend dialectical behavioral therapy while the therapist is on leave.  We would recommend continued treatment with SSRIs for dysthymia and depression.  We would suggest prescribing long acting antidepressant such as Prozac, given the patient's ambivalence regarding medications.  Prozac should be pushed to minimum of 40 mg, which the patient has already tolerated in the past, but most likely up to 60 or 80 mg.  We might also supplement the Prozac with a (anti-sleep medication).\n\nTime spent with the patient was 1.5 hours.

Psychiatric consultation has been requested as the patient has been noncompliant with treatment, leave the unit, does not return when requested, and it was unclear as to whether this is secondary to confusion or willful behavior.\n\nThe patient gives a significant history of behavioral problems from late adolescence until the onset of illness, states he had lot of trouble with law, he was convicted of assault, he was also arrested with small amount of cannabis, states he served one year incarcerated in ABCD that was about two years ago.  Gives an ongoing history of substance abuse until one year ago when he went into a drug rehabilitation program, he was discharged from that on 05/28/2006 and states he has been clean and sober since then.  Prior to going to rehabilitation, he was using intravenous heroin couple of times a week since age 17, which would have been over a period of about five years, reports heavy use of cannabis, smoking pot up to five times a day if he could.  He would drink up to half of a fifth of rum on a daily basis when available.\n\nThe patient is currently on Lexapro 10 mg in the morning and diazepam 10 mg at bedtime.  He complained of some depressive and some anxiety symptoms, but these do not appear to be out of proportion to his medical issues and, for this individual, the frustrations of his treatments.  He would have a limited support system here in Colorado.  He married in January and states that the marriage is not going particularly well, being young, sick, and hospitalized, has not helped his relationship with his new wife who apparently is expecting a child in July.  I would recommend some couples counseling as a part of their treatment here.\n\nThe patient was fairly drowsy during the interview and full past and developmental history was not obtained.  The patient's comment is that he grew up all over, that his parents had separated, that he lived with his mother, that he dropped out of school in eleventh grade, at that time was living in XYZ area because he did not like school.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  \nGENERAL:  This is a cooperative man, speech is soft and difficult to understand.  There is no thought disorder and no hallucination.  He denies being suicidal, but does express at times feelings about giving up on his treatments and primarily complaints about feeling that he is treated like a child and confined in the hospital.\nVITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.2, pulse 117, respirations 16, blood pressure 127/74, oxygen saturation 97%, and weight is 154 pounds.\nPSYCHIATRY:  There is no thought disorder, no paranoia, no delusions, and no psychotic symptoms.  Activities of daily living (ADLs) appear intact.  On formal testing, he is oriented to place.  He can give a reasonable recitation of his medical history.  He is oriented to the year, knows it is the 15th, but gave the month as June instead of May.  He can memorize four items, repeats three out of four at five minutes, gives the fourth through the category, which places short-term memory in normal limits.  He can do serial three subtractions accurately, can name objects appropriately.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Sodium of 135, BUN of 24, and glucose 119.  GGT of 355, ALT of 97, LDH of 703, and alk phos of 144.  FK506 is 28.8, which is elevated tacrolimus level.  Hematocrit 29% and white count is 7000.\n\nDIAGNOSES:  \nAXIS I:  Depressive disorder secondary to the underlying medical condition of graft-versus-host reaction.\nAXIS II:  Personality disorder, not otherwise specified (NOS).\nAXIS III:  History of polysubstance abuse, in remission.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:  \n1.  This patient appears to retain the ability to make decisions on his own behalf.  I think he is mentally competent.  Unfortunately, his impulsive low frustration personality dynamics do not fit well with the demands and requirements for treatment of this chronic illness.  If the patient refuses treatment, he understands that the consequences of this would likely be hastened mortality and he does state that he does not want to die.\n2.  The patient does complain of depressed mood, also of anxiety.  We did discuss medications.  He appeared somewhat sedated at the time of my interview.  I would recommend that we try Seroquel 25 mg twice daily on an as-needed basis to see if this diminishes anxiety.  I will have Dr. X followup with him.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me at digital pager if additional information is needed.\n\nMy overall recommendation would be that the patient be on some random urine drug screening, that he use cell phone if he goes off the unit, to be called back up when treatments are scheduled, and hopefully he will be agreeable to complying with this.

Family history of kyphosis in a maternal aunt and grandfather.  She was noted by her parents to have round back posture.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nREASON FOR VISIT:  Kyphosis.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 13-year-old new patient is here for evaluation of thoracic kyphosis.  The patient has a family history in a maternal aunt and grandfather of kyphosis.  She was noted by her parents to have round back posture.  They have previously seen another orthopedist who recommended observation at this time.  She is here for a second opinion in regards to kyphosis.  The patient denies any pain in her back or any numbness, tingling, or weakness in her upper or lower extremities.  No problems with her bowels or bladder.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  None.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Bilateral pinning of her ears.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She is currently an eighth grader at Middle School and is interested in basketball.  She lives with both of her parents and has a 9-year-old brother.  She had menarche beginning in September.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Of kyphosis in great grandmother and second cousin.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She is in her usual state of health and is negative except otherwise as mentioned in the history of present illness.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  She is currently on Zyrtec, Flonase, and Ceftin for an ear infection.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\nFINDINGS:  On physical exam, she is alert, oriented, and in no acute distress standing 63 inches tall.  In regards to her back, her skin is intact with no rashes, lesions, and/or no dimpling or hair spots.  No cafe au lait spots.  She is not tender to palpation from her occiput to her sacrum.  There is no evidence of paraspinal muscle spasm.  On forward bending, there is a mild kyphosis.  She is not able to touch her toes indicating her hamstring tightness.  She has a full 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups.  Her lower extremities including iliopsoas, quadriceps, gastroc-soleus, tibialis anterior, and extensor hallucis longus.  Her sensation intact to light touch in L1 through L2 dermatomal distributions.  She has symmetric limb lengths as well bilaterally from both the coronal and sagittal planes.\n\nX-rays today included PA and lateral sclerosis series.  She has approximately 46 degree kyphosis.\n\nASSESSMENT:  Kyphosis.\n\nPLANS:  The patient's kyphosis is quite mild.  While this is likely in the upper limits of normal or just it is normal for an adolescent and still within normal range as would be expected return at home.  At this time, three options were discussed with the parents including observation, physical therapy, and bracing.  At this juncture, given that she has continued to grow, they are Risser 0.  She may benefit from continued observation with physical therapy, bracing would be a more aggressive option certainly that thing would be lost with following at this time.  As such, she was given a prescription for physical therapy for extension based strengthening exercises, flexibility range of motion exercises, postural training with no forward bending.  We will see her back in 3 months' time for repeat radiographs at that time including PA and lateral standing of scoliosis series.  Should she show evidence of continued progression of her kyphotic deformity, discussions of bracing would be held at time.  We will see her back in 3 months' time for repeat evaluation.

She is status post craniotomy for debulking and has done well with the surgery.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nREASON FOR CONSULTATION:  Glioma.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old woman who was initially diagnosed with a brain tumor in 1982.  She underwent radiation therapy for this, although craniotomy was not successful for a biopsy because of seizure activity during the surgery.  She did well for the next 10 years or so, and developed Parkinson disease, possibly related to radiation therapy.  She has been followed by neurology, Dr. Z, to treat seizure activity.  She has a vagal stimulator in place to help control her seizure activity.\n\nOver the last few months, she has had increasing weakness on the right side.  She has been living in a nursing home.  She has not been able to walk, and she has not been able to write for the past three to four years.\n\nMRI scan done on 11/13/2006 showed increase in size of the abdominal area and the left parietal region.  There was slight enhancement and appearance was consistent with a medium- to low-grade tumor anterior to the motor cortex.\n\nSurgery was performed during this admission to remove some of the posterior part of the tumor.  She tolerated the procedure well.  She has noticed no worsening or improvement in her weakness.  Pathology shows a low- to intermediate-grade glioma.  The second opinion by Dr. A is still pending.\n\nThe patient is feeling well today.  She is not having headache, and reports no new neurologic symptoms.  She has not had leg swelling, cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  \n1.  Ambien p.r.n.  \n2.  Vicodin p.r.n.  \n3.  Actonel every Sunday.  \n4.  Colace.  \n5.  Felbatol 1200 mg b.i.d.  \n6.  Heparin injections for prophylaxis.  \n7.  Maalox p.r.n.  \n8.  Mirapex 0.5 mg t.i.d.  \n9.  Protonix 40 mg daily.  \n10.  Tylenol p.r.n.  \n11.  Zanaflex 4-mg tablet, one-half tablet daily and 6 mg at bedtime.  \n12.  She has Zofran p.r.n., albuterol inhaler q.i.d., and Aggrenox, which she is to start.\n\nThe rest of the history is mostly from the chart.\n\nALLERGIES:  SHE IS ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  \n1.  Parkinson's, likely secondary to radiation therapy.\n2.  History of prior stroke.\n3.  Seizure disorder secondary to her brain tumor.\n4.  History of urinary incontinence.\n5.  She has had hip fractures x2, which have required surgical pinning.\n6.  Appendectomy.\n7.  Cholecystectomy.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Shows that she does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol.  She lives in a nursing home.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Shows a family history of breast cancer.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  \nGENERAL:  Today, she is sitting up in the chair, alert, and appropriate.  She tends to lean towards the right.  The right arm and hand are noticeably weaker than the left.  She is quite thin.\nVITAL SIGNS:  Temperature is 98.5, blood pressure is 138/75, pulse is 76, respirations are 16, and pulse oximetry is 92% on room air.\nHEENT:  There is a craniotomy incision on the left parietal region, clean, and dry with stitches still in place.  The oropharynx shows no thrush or mucositis.\nLUNGS:  Clear bilaterally to auscultation.\nCARDIAC:  Exam shows regular rate.\nABDOMEN:  Soft.\nEXTREMITIES:  No peripheral edema or evidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is noted on the lower extremities.\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Progressive low-grade glioma, now more than 20 years since initially diagnosed.  She is status post craniotomy for debulking and has done well with the surgery.\n\nWe reviewed the phase II trials that have used Temodar in the setting of grade 2 gliomas.  Although, complete responses are rare, it is quite common to have partial response and/or stable disease, and most patients had improved quality of life indices including many patients who benefit from decreased seizure activity.  We discussed using Temodar after she heals from her surgery.  Toxicities would include fatigue, nausea, and myelosuppression primarily.\n\nThe patient's insurance is through SecureHorizons plan which we do not accept at our office, so I would discuss with Dr. Y setting her up to see another oncologist.  In the meantime, we can investigate the cost of Temodar to her, I suspect she may have a 20% copay.\n\nShe is anxious to have the Foley catheter removed before she goes to her nursing home tomorrow.  She normally does not have a Foley catheter in place.  Orders have already been written by Dr. Y to have it removed.

Patient reports that she had gestational diabetes with her first pregnancy.  She did use insulin at that time as well.  She does not fully understand what ketones are.  She walks her daughter to school and back home each day which takes 20 minutes each way.  She is not a big milk drinker, but she does try to drink some.\n\nOBJECTIVE:  Weight is 238.3 pounds.  Weight from last week s visit was 238.9 pounds.  Prepregnancy weight is reported at 235 pounds.  Height is 62-3/4 inches.  Prepregnancy BMI is approximately 42-1/2.  Insulin schedule is NovoLog 70/30, 20 units in the morning and 13 units at supper time.  Blood sugar records for the last week reveal the following:  Fasting blood sugars ranging from 92 to 104 with an average of 97, two-hour postprandial breakfast readings ranging from 172 to 196 with an average of 181, two-hour postprandial lunch readings ranging from 149 to 189 with an average of 168 and two-hour postprandial dinner readings ranging from 109 to 121 with an average of 116.  Overall average is 140.  A diet history was obtained.  Expected date of confinement is May 1, 2005.  Instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for gestational diabetes.  A 2300 meal plan was provided and reviewed.  The Lily Guide for Meal Planning was provided and reviewed.\n\nASSESSMENT:  Patient s basal energy expenditure adjusted for obesity is estimated at 1566 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirements, including physical activity factors as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals 2367 calories a day.  Her diet history reveals that she is eating three meals a day and three snacks.  The snacks were just added last week following presence of ketones in her urine.  We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are the foods that raise blood sugar the most.  We identified 15 gram equivalents of carbohydrate and established a carbohydrate budget.  We also discussed the goal of balancing food intake with blood sugar control and adequate caloric intake to sustain appropriate weight gain for the pregnancy of 1/2 a pound a week through the duration of the pregnancy.  We discussed the physiology of ketone production from inadequate calories or inadequate insulin and elevated blood sugars.  While a sample meal plan was provided reflecting the patient s carbohydrate budget I emphasized the need for her to eat according to her appetite, but to work at consistency in the volume of carbohydrates consumed at a given meal or a given snack from day to day.  Patient was assured that we can titrate the insulin to match whatever eating pattern is suitable for her as long as she can do it on a consistent basis.  At the same time she was encouraged to continue to eliminate the more concentrated forms of refined carbohydrates.\n\nPLAN:  Recommend the patient work with the following meal plan with a carbohydrate budget representing approximately 45% of the calories from carbohydrate.  Breakfast:  Three carbohydrate servings.  Morning snack:  One carbohydrate serving.  Lunch:  Four carbohydrate servings.  Afternoon snack:  One carbohydrate serving.  Supper:  Four carbohydrate servings.  Bedtime snack:  One carbohydrate serving.  Encouraged patient to include some solid protein with each of her meals as well as with the bedtime snack.  Encouraged three servings of dairy products per day to meet nutritional needs for calcium during pregnancy.  Recommend patient include a fruit or a vegetable with most of her meals.  Also recommend including solid protein with each meal as well as with the bedtime snack.  Charlie Athene reviewed blood sugars at this consultation as well, and made the following insulin adjustment:  Morning 70/30, will increase from 20 units up to 24 units and evening 70/30, we will increase from 13 units up to 16 units.  Patient was encouraged to call in blood sugars at the end of the week if they are outside of the range of over 90 fasting and over 120 two-hour postprandial.  Provided my name and number should there be additional dietary questions.

However, the chart indicates that she had recurrent TIAs x3 yesterday, each lasting about 5 minutes with facial drooping and some mental confusion.  She had also complained of blurred vision for several days.  She was brought to the emergency room last night, where she was noted to have a left carotid bruit and was felt to have recurrent TIAs.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  The patient is on Lanoxin, amoxicillin, Hydergine, Cardizem, Lasix, Micro-K and a salt-free diet.  \n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke or drink alcohol.\n\nFINDINGS:  Admission CT scan of the head showed a densely calcified mass lesion of the sphenoid bone, probably representing the benign osteochondroma seen on previous studies.  CBC was normal, aside from a hemoglobin of 11.2.  ECG showed atrial fibrillation.  BUN was 22, creatinine normal, CPK normal, glucose normal, electrolytes normal.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient is noted to be alert and fully oriented.  She has some impairment of recent memory.  She is not dysphasic, or apraxic.  Speech is normal and clear.  The head is noted to be normocephalic.  Neck is supple.  Carotid pulses are full bilaterally, with left carotid bruit.  Neurologic exam shows cranial nerve function II through XII to be intact, save for some slight flattening of the left nasolabial fold.  Motor examination shows no drift of the outstretched arms.  There is no tremor or past-pointing.  Finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin performed well bilaterally.  Motor showed intact neuromuscular tone, strength, and coordination in all limbs.  Reflexes 1+ and symmetrical, with bilateral plantar flexion, absent jaw jerk, no snout.  Sensory exam is intact to pinprick touch, vibration, position, temperature, and graphesthesia.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Neurological examination is normal, aside from mild impairment of recent memory, slight flattening of the left nasolabial fold, and left carotid bruit.  She also has atrial fibrillation, apparently chronic.  In view of her age and the fact that she is in chronic atrial fibrillation, I would suspect that she most likely has had an embolic phenomenon as the cause of her TIAs.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:  I would recommend conservative management with antiplatelet agents unless a near occlusion of the carotid arteries is demonstrated, in which case you might consider it best to do an angiography and consider endarterectomy.  In view of her age, I would be reluctant to recommend Coumadin anticoagulation.  I will be happy to follow the patient with you.

The patient was at her baseline state of health until 2 months prior to admission when her usual symptoms of allergic rhinitis worsened. In addition to increased nasal congestion and drainage, she also began having generalized fatigue, malaise, and migratory arthralgias involving bilateral wrists, shoulders, elbows, knees, ankles, and finger joints. She also had intermittent episodes of swollen fingers that prevented her from making a fist. Patient denied recent flu-like illness, fever, chills, myalgias, or night sweats. Four weeks after the onset of arthralgias patient developed severe bilateral eye dryness and redness without any discharge. She was evaluated by an ophthalmologist and diagnosed with conjunctivitis. She was given eye drops that did not relieve her eye symptoms. Two weeks prior to admission patient noted the onset of rust colored urine. No bright red blood or clots in the urine. She denied having dysuria, decreased urine output, abdominal pain, flank pain, or nausea/vomiting. Patient went to a community ER, and had a CT Scan of the abdomen that was negative for kidney stones. She was discharged from the ER with Bactrim for possible UTI. During the next week patient had progressively worsening arthralgias to the point where she could hardly walk. On the day of admission, she developed a cough productive of bright red blood associated with shortness of breath and nausea, but no chest pain or dizziness. This prompted the patient to go see her primary care physician.

Fracture of the humerus, spiral.  Possible nerve injuries to the radial and median nerve, possibly neurapraxia.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Left elbow pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 17-year-old male was fighting with some other kids in Juvenile Hall when he felt some pain in his left elbow, causing sudden pain.  He also has pain in his left ankle, but he is able to walk normally.  He has had previous pain in his left knee.  He denies any passing out, any neck pain at this time even though he did get hit in the head.  He has no chest or abdominal pain.  Apparently, no knives or guns were involved.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  He has had toe problems and left knee pain in the past.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No coughing, sputum production, dyspnea or chest pain.  No vomiting or abdominal pain.  No visual changes.  No neurologic deficits other than some numbness in his left hand.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  He is in Juvenile Hall for about 25 more days.  He is a nonsmoker.\n\nALLERGIES:  MORPHINE.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Abilify.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Stable.  HEENT:  PERRLA.  EOMI.  Conjunctivae anicteric.  Skull is normocephalic.  He is not complaining of bruising.  HEENT:  TMs and canals are normal.  There is no Battle sign.  NECK:  Supple.  He has good range of motion.  Spinal processes are normal to palpation.  LUNGS:  Clear.  CARDIAC:  Regular rate.  No murmurs or rubs.  EXTREMITIES:  Left elbow is tender.  He does not wish to move it at all.  Shoulder and clavicle are within normal limits.  Wrist is normal to inspection.  He does have some pain to palpation.  Hand has good capillary refill.  He seems to have decreased sensation in all three dermatomes.  He has moderately good abduction of all fingers.  He has moderate opponens strength with his thumb.  He has very good extension of all of his fingers with good strength.\n\nWe did an x-ray of his elbow.  He has a spiral fracture of the distal one-third of the humerus, about 13 cm in length.  The proximal part looks like it is in good position.  The distal part has about 6 mm of displacement.  There is no significant angulation.  The joint itself appears to be intact.  The fracture line ends where it appears above the joint.  I do not see any extra blood in the joint.  I do not see any anterior or posterior Siegert sign.\n\nI spoke with Dr. X.  He suggests we go ahead and splint him up and he will follow the patient up.  At this point, it does not seem like there needs to be any surgical revision.  The chance of a compartment syndrome seems very low at this time.\n\nUsing 4-inch Ortho-Glass and two assistants, we applied a posterior splint to immobilize his fingers, hand, and wrist all the way up to his elbow to well above the elbow.\n\nHe had much better comfort once this was applied.  There was good color to his fingers and again, much better comfort.\n\nOnce that was on, I took some 5-inch Ortho-Glass and put in extra reinforcement around the elbow so he would not be moving it, straightening it or breaking the fiberglass.\n\nWe then gave him a sling.\n\nWe gave him #2 Vicodin p.o. and #4 to go.

A 4-mm laceration.  Acute foot pain, now resolved.   The patient was given discharge instructions on wound care.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Cut on foot.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 32-year-old male who had a piece of glass fall on to his right foot today.

MUSCULOSKELETAL:  The patient has a 4-mm partial thickness laceration to the top of the right foot and about the area of the mid foot.  There is no palpable foreign body, no foreign body is visualized.  There is no active bleeding, there is no exposed deeper tissues and certainly no exposed tendons, bone, muscle, nerves, or vessels.  It appears that the laceration may have nicked a small varicose vein, which would have accounted for the heavier than usual bleeding that currently occurred at home.  The patient does not have any tenderness to the foot.  The patient has full range of motion to all the joints, all the toes, as well as the ankles.  The patient ambulates well without any difficulty or discomfort.  There are no other injuries noted to the rest of the body.  SKIN:  The 4-mm partial thickness laceration to the right foot as previously described.  No other injuries are noted.  NEUROLOGIC:  Motor is 5/5 to all the muscle groups of the right lower extremity.  Sensory is intact to light touch to all the dermatomes of the right foot.

The patient does have a history of alcohol abuse, but mostly he is concerned about the heroin abuse.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Detox from heroin.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 52-year-old gentleman with a long history of heroin abuse, who keeps relapsing, presents once again, trying to get off the heroin, last use shortly prior to arrival including cocaine.  The patient does have a history of alcohol abuse, but mostly he is concerned about the heroin abuse.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for chronic pain.  He has had multiple stab wounds, gunshot wounds, and a variety of other injuries that resulted him having chronic pain and he states that is what triggers of him getting on heroin to try to get out of pain.  He has previously been followed by ABC but has not seen him for several years.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient states that he did use heroin as well as cocaine earlier today and feels under the influence.  Denies any headache or visual complaints.  No hallucinations.  No chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain or back pain.  Denies any abscesses.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a smoker.  Admits to heroin use, alcohol abuse as well.  Also admits today using cocaine.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  He has previously been on analgesics and pain medications chronically.  Apparently, he just recently got out of prison.  He has previously also been on Klonopin and lithium.  He was previously on codeine for this pain.\n\nALLERGIES:  NONE.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  The patient is afebrile.  He is markedly hypertensive, 175/104 and pulse 117 probably due to the cocaine onboard.  His respiratory rate is normal at 18.  GENERAL:  The patient is a little jittery but lucid, alert, and oriented to person, place, time, and situation.  HEENT:  Unremarkable.  Pupils are actually moderately dilated about 4 to 5 mm, but reactive.  Extraoculars are intact.  His oropharynx is clear.  NECK:  Supple.  His trachea is midline.  LUNGS:  Clear.  He has good breath sounds and no wheezing.  No rales or rhonchi.  Good air movement and no cough.  CARDIAC:  Without murmur.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.

She is not exhibiting any symptoms and parents were explained that if she develops any vomiting, she should be brought back for reevaluation.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Possible exposure to ant bait.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 14-month-old child who apparently was near the sink, got into the childproof cabinet and pulled out ant bait that had Borax in it.  It had 11 mL of this fluid in it.  She spilled it on her, had it on her hands.  Parents were not sure whether she ingested any of it.  So, they brought her in for evaluation.  They did not note any symptoms of any type.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Negative.  Generally very healthy.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The child has not been having any coughing, gagging, vomiting, or other symptoms.  Acting perfectly normal.  Family mostly noted that she had spilled it on the ground around her, had it on her hands, and on her clothes.  They did not witness that she ingested any, but did not see anything her mouth.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  None.\n\nALLERGIES:  NONE.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  The patient was afebrile.  Stable vital signs and normal pulse oximetry.  GENERAL:  The child is very active, cheerful youngster, in no distress whatsoever.  HEENT:  Unremarkable.  Oral mucosa is clear, moist, and well hydrated.  I do not see any evidence of any sort of liquid on the face.  Her clothing did have the substance on the clothes, but I did not see any evidence of anything on her torso.  Apparently, she had some on her hands that has been wiped off.\n\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  I discussed the case with Poison Control and apparently this is actually relatively small quantity and it is likely to be a nontoxic ingestion if she even ingested, which should does not appear likely to be the case.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Exposure to ant bait.\n\nPLAN:  At this point, it is fairly unlikely that this child ingested any significant amount, if at all, which seems unlikely.  She is not exhibiting any symptoms and I explained to the parents that if she develops any vomiting, she should be brought back for reevaluation.  So, the patient is discharged in stable condition.

I offered Anodyne physical therapy, but she was not interested yet at this point.  I suspect that her peripheral neuropathy may be due to her essential thrombocythemia.  We did send her to lab for a CBC due to her anemia and essential thrombocythemia and she needs sed rate due to her peripheral neuropathy, ferritin due to her anemia, and Hemoccult cards x 3 due to anemia.  She needs a DT immunization.  Recheck with me in about three months.  I refilled her Ambien 5 mg at h.s. for one year.  She may get a flu shot next month.

She describes her dizziness as both vertigo and lightheadedness.  She does not have a headache at present but has some intermittent headaches, neck pains, and generalized myalgias.  She has noticed a few more bruises on her legs.  No fever or chills with slight cough.  She has had more chest pains but not at present.  She does have a little bit of nausea but no vomiting or diarrhea.  She complains of some left shoulder tenderness and discomfort.  She reports her blood sugar today after lunch was 155.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  She is currently on her nystatin ointment to her lips q.i.d. p.r.n.  She is still using a triamcinolone 0.1% cream t.i.d. to her left wrist rash and her Bactroban ointment t.i.d. p.r.n. to her bug bites on her legs.  Her other meds remain as per the dictation of 07/30/2004 with the exception of her Klonopin dose being 4 mg in a.m. and 6 mg at h.s. instead of what the psychiatrist had recommended which should be 6 mg and 8 mg.\n\nALLERGIES:  Sulfa, erythromycin, Macrodantin, and tramadol.\n\nOBJECTIVE:\nGeneral:  She is a well-developed, well-nourished, obese female in no acute distress.\nVital Signs:  Her age is 55.

Headaches.\n2.  Dizziness.\n3.  Atypical chest pains.\n4.  Chronic renal failure.\n5.  Type II diabetes.\n6.  Myalgias.\n7.  Severe anxiety (affect is still quite anxious.)\n\nPLAN:  I strongly encouraged her to increase her Klonopin to what the psychiatrist recommended, which should be 6 mg in the a.m. and 8 mg in the p.m.  I sent her to lab for CPK due to her myalgias and pro-time for monitoring her Coumadin.  Recheck in one week.  I think her dizziness is multifactorial and due to enlarged part of her anxiety.  I do note that she does have a few new bruises on her extremities, which is likely due to her Coumadin.

She was discharged home on 1/19/96 and returned on 2/11/96 after neurologic deterioration. She progressively developed more illogical behavior, anhedonia, anorexia and changes in sleep pattern. She became completely dependent and could not undergo repeat neuropsychologic assessment in 2/96. She was later transferred to another care facility against medical advice. The etiology for these changes became complicated by a newly discovered history of possible ETOH abuse and usual &quot;anxiety&quot; disorder.\n\nMRI brain, 2/14/96, revealed increased T2 signal within the periventricular white matter, bilaterally. EEG showed diffuse slowing without epileptiform activity.

She was unfortunately outside of the window for emergent treatment and had a negative CT scan of the head. Was started on protocol medication and that is similar to TPA, which is an investigational study.\n\nDuring the evaluation she was found to be in atrial fibrillation on admission with hypertension that was treated with labetalol en route. Her heart rate was 130. She was brought down with Cardizem. She received the study drug in the night and about an hour later thought to have another large stroke effecting the opposite side of the brain, that the doctors and company think is probably cardioembolic and not related to the study drug, as TPA has no obvious known association with this.\n\nAt that time the patient became comatose and required emergent intubation and paralyzation. Her diastolic at that time rose up to 190, likely the result of the acute second stroke. She is currently in arteriogram and a clot has been extracted from the proximal left carotid, but there is still distal clot that they are working on. Dr. A has updated the family to her extremely guarded and critical prognosis.\n\nAt present, it is not known yet, we do not have the STAT echocardiogram, if she has a large clot in the heart or if she could have a patent foramen ovale clot in the legs that has been passed to the heart. Echo that is pending, and cannot be done till the patient is out of arteriogram, which is her lifesaving procedure right now.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Complete review of systems is unobtainable at present. From what I can tell, is that she is scheduled for an upcoming bladder distension surgery and I do not know if this is why she is off Coumadin for chronic AFib or what, at this point. Tremor for 3-4 years, diagnosed as early Parkinson's.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: GERD, hypertension times 20 years, arthritis, Parkinson's, TIA, chronic atrial fibrillation, on Coumadin three years.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Cholecystectomy, TAH 33, gallstones, back surgery 1998, thoracotomy for unknown reason at present.\n\nALLERGIES: MORPHINE, SULFAS (RASH), PROZAC.\n\nMEDICATIONS AT HOME: Lanoxin 0.25 daily; Inderal LA 80 daily; MOBIC 7.5 daily; Robaxin 750 q.8; aspirin 80 one daily; acyclovir dose unknown daily; potassium, dose unknown; oxazepam 15 mg daily; aspirin 80 one daily; ibuprofen PRN; Darvocet-N 100 PRN.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: She does not drink or smoke. Lives in Fayetteville, Tennessee.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY: Mother died of cancer, unknown type. Dad died of an MI.\n\nVACCINATION STATUS: Unknown.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nVITAL SIGNS: On arrival were temperature 97.1, blood pressure 174/100, heart rate 100, 97%, respirations 15.\nGENERAL: She was apparently alert and able to give history on arrival. Currently do not have any available vital signs or physical exam, as I cannot get to the patient.\n\nLABORATORY: Reviewed and are remarkable for white count of 13 with 76 neutrophils. BMP is normal, except for a blood sugar of 157, hemoglobin A1c is pending. TSH 2.1, cholesterol 165, Digoxin 1.24, CPK 57. ABG 7.47/32/459 on 100%. Magnesium 1.5. ESR 9, coags normal.\n\nEKG is pending my review.\n\nChest x-ray is read as mild cardiomegaly and atherosclerotic aorta.\n\nChest x-ray, shoulder films and CT scan of the head: I have reviewed. Chest x-ray has good ET tube placement. She has mild cardiomegaly. Some mild interstitial opacities consistent with OGD and minimal amount of atherosclerosis of the aorta.\n\nCT scan of the head: I do not see any active bleeding.\n\nX-rays of the shoulders appear intact to me and we are awaiting radiologies final approval on those.\n\nASSESSMENT/PLAN/PROBLEMS:\n1. Large cardioembolic stroke initially to the right brain, with devastating effects, and now stroke into the left brain as well, with fluctuating mental status. Obviously she is in critical condition and stable with multiple strokes. One must also wonder if she could have a large clot burden below the heart and patent foramen ovale, etc. We need STAT records from her prior cardiologist and prior echocardiogram report to see exactly what are the details. I have ordered a STAT echo and to have the group that sees her read it, that if he has a large clot burdened in the heart or has distal clot with a PFO we may be able to better prognosticate at this point. Obviously, she cannot have any anticoagulants, except for the study drug, at present, which is her only chance and hopefully they will be able to retrieve most of the clot with emergency retrieval device as activated heroically, by Dr. A and interventional radiology.\n2. Hypertension/atrial fibrillation: This will be a difficult management and the fact that she has been on a beta-blocker for Parkinson's, she may have withdrawal to the beta-blockers as we remove this. Given her atrial fibrillation, I do agree the safest agent right now is to use a Cardizem drip as needed and would use it for systolic greater than 160 to 180, or diastolics greater than 90 to 100. Also, would use it to control the atrial fibrillation. We would, however, be very cautious not to put her in heart block with the Digoxin and the beta-blocker on board. Weighing all risks and benefits, I think that given the fact that she has a beta-blocker on board and Digoxin, we would like to avoid the beta-blocker for vasospasm protection and will favor using calcium channel blocker for now. If, however, we run into trouble with this, I would prefer to switch her to Brevibloc or an Esmolol drip and see how she does, as she may withdraw from the beta-blocker. I will be watching this closely and managing the hypertension as I see fit at the moment, based on all factors. Will also ask cardiology if she has one that sees her here, to help guide this. Her Digoxin level is appropriate, as well as a TSH. I do not feel that we need to work this up further, other than the STAT echo and ultrasound of the leg.\n3. Respiratory failure requiring ventilator: I have discussed this with Dr. Devlin, we do not feel the need to hyperventilate her at present. We will keep her comfortable on the breathing machine and try to keep her pH in a normal range, around 7.4, and her CO2 in the 30 to 40 range. If she has brain swelling, we will need to hyperventilate her to a pCO2 of 30 and a pH of 7.5, to optimize the cardiac arrhythmia potential of alkalosis weighed with the control of brain swelling.\n4. Optimize electrolytes as you can.\n5. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis for now, with thigh-high TED hose, possibly SCDs, although I do not have experience with the vampire/venom to know if we need to worry about DIC which the SCDs may worsen. Will follow daily CBCs for that.\n6. Nutrition: Will go ahead and start a low dose of tube feeds and hope that she does survive.\n\nI will defer all updates to the family for the next 24 to 48 hours to Dr. Devlin's expertise, given her unknown and fluctuating neurologic prognosis.\n\nThank you so much for allowing us to participate in her care. We will be happy to do all medication treatment until the point that I feel that I would need any help from critical care. I believe that we will be able to manage her fully at this point, for simplicity sake.

Remote history of lung cancer with prior resection of the left upper lobe.\n5. Anxiety and depression.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Details are present in the dictated report.\n\nBRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 71-year-old lady who came in with increased shortness of breath of one day duration. She denied history of chest pain or fevers or cough with purulent sputum at that time. She was empirically treated with a course of antibiotics of Avelox for ten days. She also received steroids, prednisolone 60 mg, and breathing treatments with albuterol, Ipratropium and her bronchodilator therapy was also optimized with theophylline. She continued to receive Coumadin for her chronic atrial fibrillation. Her heart rate was controlled and was maintained in the 60s-70s. On the third day of admission she developed worsening respiratory failure with fatigue, and hence was required to be intubated and ventilated. She was put on mechanical ventilation from 1/29 to 2/6/06. She was extubated on 2/6 and put on BI-PAP. The pressures were gradually increased from 10 and 5 to 15 of BI-PAP and 5 of E-PAP with FIO2 of 35% at the time of transfer to Kindred. Her bronchospasm also responded to the aggressive bronchodilation and steroid therapy.\n\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Prednisolone 60 mg orally once daily, albuterol 2.5 mg nebulized every 4 hours, Atrovent Respules to be nebulized every 6 hours, Pulmicort 500 micrograms nebulized twice every 8 hours, Coumadin 5 mg orally once daily, magnesium oxide 200 mg orally once daily.\n\nTRANSFER INSTRUCTIONS: The patient is to be strictly kept on bi-level PAP of 15 I-PAP/E-PAP of 5 cm and FIO2 of 35% for most of the times during the day. She may be put on nasal cannula 2 to 3 liters per minute with an O2 saturation of 90-92% at meal times only, and that is to be limited to 1-2 hours every meal. On admission her potassium had risen slightly to 5.5, and hence her ACE inhibitor had to be discontinued. We may restart it again at a later date once her blood pressure control is better if required.

Deviated nasal septum.  Inferior turbinate hypertrophy.  Chronic rhinitis. Conductive hearing loss.  Tympanosclerosis.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nHISTORY:  The patient is a 51-year-old female that was seen in consultation at the request of Dr. X on 06/04/2008 regarding chronic nasal congestion, difficulty with swallowing, and hearing loss.  The patient reports that she has been having history of recurrent sinus infection, averages about three times per year.  During the time that she gets the sinus infections, she has nasal congestion, nasal drainage, and also generally develops an ear infection as well.  The patient does note that she has been having hearing loss.  This is particular prominent in the right ear now for the past three to four years.  She does note popping after blowing the nose.  Occasionally, the hearing will improve and then it plugs back up again.  She seems to be plugged within the nasal passage, more on the right side than the left and this seems to be year round issue with her.  She tried Flonase nasal spray to see if this help with this and has been taking it, but has not seen a dramatic improvement.  She has had a history of swallowing issues and that again secondary to the persistent postnasal drainage.  She feels that she is having a hard time swallowing at times as well.  She has complained of a lump sensation in the throat that tends to come and go.  She denies any cough, no hemoptysis, no weight change.  No night sweats, fever or chills has been noted.  She is having at this time no complaints of tinnitus or vertigo.  The patient presents today for further workup, evaluation, and treatment of the above-listed symptoms.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  \nALLERGY/IMMUNOLOGIC:  History of seasonal allergies.  She also has severe allergy to penicillin and bee stings.\nCARDIOVASCULAR:  Pertinent for hypercholesterolemia.\nPULMONARY:  She has a history of cough, wheezing.\nGASTROINTESTINAL:  Negative.\nGENITOURINARY:  Negative.\nNEUROLOGIC:  She has had a history of TIAs in the past.\nVISUAL:  She does have history of vision change, wears glasses.\nDERMATOLOGIC:  Negative.\nENDOCRINE:  Negative.\nMUSCULOSKELETAL:  History of joint pain and bursitis.\nCONSTITUTIONAL:  She has a history of chronic fatigue.\nENT:  She has had a history of cholesteatoma removal from the right middle ear and previous tympanoplasty with a progressive hearing loss in the right ear over the past few years according to the patient.\nPSYCHOLOGIC:  History of anxiety, depression.\nHEMATOLOGIC:  Easy bruising.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She has had right tympanoplasty in 1984.  She has had a left carotid endarterectomy, cholecystectomy, two C sections, hysterectomy, and appendectomy.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Mother, history of vaginal cancer and hypertension.  Brother, colon CA.  Father, hypertension.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 81 mg daily.  She takes vitamins one a day.  She is on Zocor, Desyrel, Flonase, and Xanax.  She also has been taking Chantix for smoking cessation.\n\nALLERGIES:  Penicillin causes throat swelling.  She also notes the bee sting allergy causes throat and tongue swelling.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is single.  She is unemployed at this time.  She is a smoker about a pack and a half for 38 years and notes rare alcohol use.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  \nVITAL SIGNS:  Her blood pressure 128/78, temperature is 98.6, pulse 80 and regular.\nGENERAL:  The patient is an alert, cooperative, well-developed 51-year-old female.  She has a normal-sounding voice and good memory.\nHEAD & FACE:  Inspected with no scars, lesions or masses noted.  Sinuses palpated and are normal.  Salivary glands also palpated and are normal with no masses noted.  The patient also has full facial function.\nCARDIOVASCULAR:  Heart regular rate and rhythm without murmur.\nRESPIRATORY:  Lungs auscultated and noted to be clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezing or rubs and normal respiratory effort.\nEYES:  Extraocular muscles were tested and within normal limits.\nEARS:  Right ear, the external ear is normal.  The ear canal is clean and dry.  The drum is intact.  She has got severe tympanosclerosis of the right tympanic membrane and Weber exam does lateralize to the right ear indicative of a conductive loss.  Left ear, the external ear is normal.  The ear canal is clean and dry.  The drum is intact and mobile with grossly normal hearing.  The audiogram does reveal normal hearing in the left ear.  She has got a mild conductive loss throughout all frequency ranges in the right ear with excellent discrimination scores noted bilaterally.  Tympanograms, there was no adequate seal obtained on the right side.  She has a normal type A tympanogram, left side.\nNASAL:  Reveals a deviated nasal septum to the left, clear drainage, large inferior turbinates, no erythema.\nORAL:  Oral cavity is normal with good moisture.  Lips, teeth and gums are normal.  Evaluation of the oropharynx reveals normal mucosa, normal palates, and posterior oropharynx.  Examination of the larynx with a mirror reveals normal epiglottis, false and true vocal cords with good mobility of the cords.  The nasopharynx was briefly examined by mirror with normal appearing mucosa, posterior choanae and eustachian tubes.\nNECK:  The neck was examined with normal appearance.  Trachea in the midline.  The thyroid was normal, nontender, with no palpable masses or adenopathy noted.\nNEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerves II through XII evaluated and noted to be normal.  Patient oriented times 3.\nDERMATOLOGIC:  Evaluation reveals no masses or lesions.  Skin turgor is normal.\n\nPROCEDURE:  Please note a fiberoptic laryngoscopy was also done at today's visit for further evaluation because of the patient's dysphagia and throat symptoms.  Findings do reveal moderately deviated nasal septum to the left, large inferior turbinates noted.  The nasopharynx does reveal moderate adenoid pad within this midline.  It is nonulcerated.  The larynx revealed both cords to be normal.  She does have mild lingual tonsillar hypertrophy as well.\n\nIMPRESSION:  \n1.  Persistent dysphagia.  I think secondary most likely to the persistent postnasal drainage.\n2.  Deviated nasal septum.\n3.  Inferior turbinate hypertrophy.\n4.  Chronic rhinitis.\n5.  Conductive hearing loss, right ear with a history of cholesteatoma of the right ear.\n6.  Tympanosclerosis, right tympanic membrane.\n7.  Tobacco use.\n8.  Chronic adenoiditis.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:  I went ahead and placed her on Levaquin 500 mg daily for the next 10 days to see if this helps clear up the current sinus condition that she has been having.  I have recommended hypertonic saline nasal irrigation twice a day.  I have ordered a CT of the paranasal sinus, also a CT of the temporal bone has been ordered for evaluation regarding the cholesteatoma of the right ear and conductive hearing loss.  CT of the sinus is felt to be warranted due to the frequency of the sinusitis issues that she has been having.  I switched her from Flonase to Nasacort AQ nasal spray one to two sprays each nostril daily.  I have scheduled a recheck evaluation with me in three weeks, and we will make further recommendations at that time.

The patient reports she has been having daily headaches since 02/25/2008.  She has been getting pulsations in the head with heartbeat sounds.  Headaches are now averaging about three times per week.  They are generally on the very top of the head according to the patient.  Interestingly, she denies any previous significant history of headaches prior to this.  There has been no nausea associated with the headaches.  The patient does note that when she speaks on the phone, the left ear has &quot;weird sounds.&quot;  She feels a general fullness in the left ear.  She does note pulsation sounds within that left ear only.  This began on February 17th according to the patient.  The patient reports that the ear pulsations began following an air flight to Iowa where she was visiting family.  The patient does admit that the pulsations in the ears seem to be somewhat better over the past few weeks.  Interestingly, there has been no significant drop or change in her hearing.  She does report she has had dizzy episodes in the past with nausea, being off balance at times.  It is not associated with the pulsations in the ear.  She does admit the pulsations will tend to come and go and there had been periods where the pulsations have completely cleared in the ear.  She is denying any vision changes.  The headaches are listed as moderate to severe in intensity on average about three to four times per week.  She has been taking Tylenol and Excedrin to try to control the headaches and that seems to be helping somewhat.

The patient also has full facial function.\nCARDIOVASCULAR:  Heart regular rate and rhythm without murmur.\nRESPIRATORY:  Lungs auscultated and noted to be clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezing or rubs and normal respiratory effort.\nEYES:  Extraocular muscles were tested and within normal limits.\nEARS:  There is an old mastoidectomy scar, left ear.  The ear canals are clean and dry.  Drums intact and mobile.  Weber exam is midline.  Grossly hearing is intact.  Please note audiologist not available at today's visit for further audiologic evaluation.\nNASAL:  Reveals clear drainage.  Deviated nasal septum to the left, listed as mild to moderate.  Ostiomeatal complexes are patent and turbinates are healthy.  There was no mass or neoplasm within the nasopharynx noted on fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy.  See fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy separate exam.\nORAL:  Oral cavity is normal with good moisture.  Lips, teeth and gums are normal.  Evaluation of the oropharynx reveals normal mucosa, normal palates, and posterior oropharynx.  Examination of the larynx with a mirror reveals normal epiglottis, false and true vocal cords with good mobility of the cords.  The nasopharynx was briefly examined by mirror with normal appearing mucosa, posterior choanae and eustachian tubes.\nNECK:  The neck was examined with normal appearance.  Trachea in the midline.  The thyroid was normal, nontender, with no palpable masses or adenopathy noted.\nNEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerves II through XII evaluated and noted to be normal.  Patient oriented times 3.\nDERMATOLOGIC:  Evaluation reveals no masses or lesions.  Skin turgor is normal.\n\nIMPRESSION:  \n1.  Pulsatile tinnitus, left ear with eustachian tube disorder as the etiology.  Consider, also normal pressure hydrocephalus.\n2.  Recurrent headaches.\n3.  Deviated nasal septum.\n4.  Dizziness, again also consider possible Meniere disease.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:  I did recommend the patient begin a 2 g or less sodium diet.  I have also ordered a carotid ultrasound study as part of the workup and evaluation.  She has had a recent CAT scan of the brain though this was without contrast.  It did reveal previous mastoidectomy, left temporal bone, but no other mass noted.  I have started her on Nasacort AQ nasal spray one spray each nostril daily as this is eustachian tube related.  Hearing protection devices should be used at all times as well.  I did counsel the patient if she has any upcoming airplane trips to use nasal decongestant or topical nasal decongestant spray prior to boarding the plane, and also using the airplane ear plugs as these can be effective at helping to prevent eustachian tube issues.  I am going to recheck her in three weeks.  If the pulsatile tinnitus at that time is not clear, we have discussed other treatment options including myringotomy or ear tube placement, which could be done here in the office.  She will be scheduled for a audio and tympanogram to be done as well prior to that procedure.

He was admitted for disorganized and assaultive behaviors while off all medications for the last six months.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nIDENTIFYING DATA:  The patient is a 45-year-old white male.  He is unemployed, presumably on disability and lives with his partner.\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  &quot;I'm in jail because I was wrongly arrested.&quot; The patient is admitted on a 72-hour Involuntary Treatment Act for grave disability.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient has minimal insight into the circumstances that resulted in this admission.  He reports being diagnosed with AIDS and schizophrenia for some time, but states he believes that he has maintained his stable baseline for many months of treatment for either condition.  Prior to admission, the patient was brought to Emergency Room after he attempted to shoplift from a local department store, during which he apparently slapped his partner.  The patient was disorganized with police and emergency room staff, and he was ultimately detained on a 72-hour Involuntary Treatment Act for grave disability.\n\nOn the interview, the patient is still disorganized and confused.  He believes that he has been arrested and is in jail.  Reports a history of mental health treatment, but denies benefiting from this in the past and does not think that it is currently necessary.\n\nI was able to contact his partner by telephone.  His partner reports the patient is paranoid and has bizarre behavior at baseline over the time that he has known him for the last 16 years, with occasional episodes of symptomatic worsening, from which he spontaneously recovers.  His partner estimates the patient spends about 20% of the year in episodes of worse symptoms.  His partner states that in the last one to two months, the patient has become worse than he has ever seen him with increased paranoia above the baseline and he states the patient has been barricading himself in his house and unplugging all electrical appliances for unclear reasons.  He also reports the patient has been sleeping less and estimates his average duration to be three to four hours a night.  He also reports the patient has been spending money impulsively in the last month and has actually incurred overdraft charges on his checking account on three different occasions recently.  He also reports that the patient has been making threats of harm to him and that His partner no longer feels that he is safe having him at home.  He reports that the patient has been eating regularly with no recent weight loss.  He states that the patient is observed responding to internal stimuli, occasionally at baseline, but this has gotten worse in the last few months.  His partner was unaware of any obvious medical changes in the last one to two months coinciding with onset of recent symptomatic worsening.  He reports of the patient's longstanding poor compliance with treatment of his mental health or age-related conditions and attributes this to the patient's dislike of taking medicine.  He also reports that the patient has expressed the belief in the past that he does not suffer from either condition.\n\nPAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:  The patient's partner reports that the patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia in his 20s and he has been hospitalized on two occasions in the 1980s and that there was a third admission to a psychiatric facility, but the date of this admission is currently unknown.  The patient was last enrolled in an outpatient mental health treatment in mid 2009.  He dropped out of care about six months ago when he moved with his partner.  His partner reports the patient was most recently prescribed Seroquel, which, though the patient denied benefiting from, his partner felt was &quot;useful, but not dosed high enough.&quot; Past medication trials that the patient reports include Haldol and lithium, neither of which he found to be particularly helpful.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient reports being diagnosed with HIV and AIDS in 1994 and believes this was secondary to unprotected sexual contact in the years prior to his diagnosis.  He is currently followed at Clinic, where he has both an assigned physician and a case manager, but treatment compliance has been poor with no use of antiretroviral meds in the last year.  The patient is fairly vague on his history of AIDS related conditions, but does identify the following:  Thrush, skin lesions, and lung infections; additional details of these problems are not currently known.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  None.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\nSOCIAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his partner.  He is unemployed.  Details of his educational and occupational history are not currently known.  His source of finances is also unknown, though social security disability is presumed.\n\nSUBSTANCE AND ALCOHOL HISTORY:  The patient smoked one to two packs per day for most of the last year, but has increased this to two to three packs per day in the last month.  His partner reports that the patient consumed alcohol occasionally, but denies any excessive or binge use recently.  The patient reports smoking marijuana a few times in his life, but not recently.  Denies other illicit substance use.\n\nLEGAL HISTORY:  Unknown.\n\nGENETIC PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:  Also unknown.\n\nMENTAL STATUS EXAM:\nAttitude:  The patient demonstrates only variable cooperation with interview, requires frequent redirection to respond to questions.  His appearance is cachectic.  The patient is poorly groomed.\nPsychomotor:  There is no psychomotor agitation or retardation.  No other observed extrapyramidal symptoms or tardive dyskinesia.\nAffect:  His affect is fairly detached.\nMood:  Describes his mood is &quot;okay.&quot;\nSpeech:  His speech is normal rate and volume.  Tone, his volume was decreased initially, but this improved during the course of the interview.\nThought Process:  His thought processes are markedly tangential.\nThought content:  The patient is fairly scattered.  He will provide history with frequent redirection, but he does not appear to stay on one topic for any length of time.  He denies currently auditory or visual hallucinations, though his partner says that this is a feature present at baseline.  Paranoid delusions are elicited.\nHomicidal/Suicidal Ideation:  He denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.  Denies previous suicide attempts.\nCognitive Assessment:  Cognitively, he is alert and oriented to person and year only.  His memory is intact to names of his Madison Clinic providers.\nInsight/Judgment:  His insight is absent as evidenced by his repeated questioning of the validity of his AIDS and mental health diagnoses.  His judgment is poor as evidenced by his longstanding pattern of minimal engagement in treatment of his mental health and physical health conditions.\nAssets:  His assets include his housing and his history of supportive relationship with his partner over many years.\nLimitations:  His limitations include his AIDS and his history of poor compliance with treatment.\n\nFORMULATION:  The patient is a 45-year-old white male with a history of schizophrenia and AIDS.  He was admitted for disorganized and assaultive behaviors while off all medications for the last six months.  It is unclear to me how much his presentation is a direct expression of an AIDS-related condition, though I suspect the impact of his HIV status is likely to be substantial.\n\nDIAGNOSES:\nAXIS I:  Schizophrenia by history.  Rule out AIDS-induced psychosis.  Rule out AIDS-related cognitive disorder.\nAXIS II:  Deferred.\nAXIS III:  AIDS (stable by his report).  Anemia.\nAXIS IV:  Relationship strain and the possibility that he may be unable to return to his home upon discharge; minimal engagement in mental health and HIV-related providers.\nAXIS V:  Global Assessment Functioning is currently 15.\n\nPLAN:  I will attempt to increase the database, will specifically request records from the last mental health providers.  The Internal Medicine Service will evaluate and treat any acute medical issues that could be helpful to collaborate with his providers at Clinic regarding issues related to his AIDS diagnosis.  With the patient's permission, I will start quetiapine at a dose of 100 mg at bedtime, given the patient's partner report of partial, but response to this agent in the past.  I anticipate titrating further for effect during the course of his admission.

He is a 57-year-old assembly worker who was injured on June 13, 2007, which according to his FROI was due to &quot;repairing cars, down on knees to work on concrete floors.&quot;  In addition, he slipped on an air hose on the floor at work on March 7, 2007, re-injuring his left knee.  He developed pain and swelling in his left knee.  He denies having any difficulties with his left knee prior to the injury of June 13, 2002.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:  August 2, 2002, MRI of the left knee showed low-grade chondromalacia of the left patellofemoral joint space and a posterior horn tear of the medial meniscus, likely degenerative in nature, and also grade II to III chondromalacia of the medial joint space.  On June 26, 2007, MRI of his left knee was referred to in the injury management report of June 19, 2007, as showing osteoarthritis of the medial compartment has advanced.  He brought with him copies of x-rays taken July 16, 2007, of his left knee, which I reviewed and which showed marked narrowing of the medial compartment of his left knee with spurs on the margins of the joint medially and also spurs on the patella.  There was subluxation of the tibia on the femur with standing.\n\nAfter his injury, he received treatment from Dr. X for patellofemoral syndrome with knee sleeve.  He also received treatment from Dr. Y also for left knee sprain and patellar pain.  He also did exercise, does use a knee sleeve and Aleve.  On December 5, 2002, he underwent arthroscopy of the left knee by Dr. Z who did a partial resection of a torn medial meniscus.  He also noticed grade III chondromalacia of the patella as well as the torn medial meniscus.  He states that he was asymptomatic until he slipped on an air hose while at work on March 7, 2007, and again developed pain and swelling in his left knee.  Standing aggravates his pain.  He has had one injection of cortisone by Dr. Z about a month ago, which has helped his pain.  He takes one hydrocodone 7.5/750 mg daily.\n\nExamination of his left knee revealed there was bilateral varus deformity, healed arthroscopy incisional scars, there was a 1/2 atrophy of the left calf.  There was patellar crepitus with knee motion.  There was no motor weakness or reflex changes.  He walked without a limp and could stand on his heels and toes equally well.  There was no instability of the knee and no effusion.  Range of motion was 0 to 120 degrees.\n\nQUESTION:  Xxxxx has recently filed to reactivate this claim.  Please give me your opinion as to whether Xxxxx's current clinical presentation is related to the industrial injury stated above.\n\nANSWER: Yes.  His original MRI of August 2, 2002, did show low-grade chondromalacia of the patellofemoral joint and also grade II to III chondromalacia of the medial joint space, which was the beginning of osteoarthritis.  Also, it is well known that torn medial meniscus can result in osteoarthritis of the knee; therefore, the osteoarthritis is related to his original injury of June 13, 2007, specifically to the torn medial meniscus.\n\nQUESTION:  Do I believe that claim #123 should be reactivated to allow for treatment of the allowed conditions as stated?\n\nANSWER: Yes, I believe it should be reactivated to allow treatment of the contested condition of osteoarthritis of his left knee.\n\nQUESTION:  Xxxxx has filed an application for additional allowance of osteoarthritis of the left knee.  Based on the current objective findings, mechanism of injury, medical records, and diagnostic studies, does the medical evidence support the existence of the requested condition?\n\nANSWER: Yes.  Please see the discussion in the answer to question no one.  In addition, x-rays of July 16, 2007, do reveal medial compartment and patellofemoral compartment osteoarthritis of the left knee.\n\nQUESTION:  If you find this condition exists, is it a direct and proximate result of the June 13, 2002, injury?\n\nANSWER: Yes.  See discussion in answer to question number one.\n\nQUESTION:  Do you find that Xxxxx's injury or disability was caused by the natural deterioration of tissue, an organ or part of body?\n\nANSWER: No.  I believe the osteoarthritis was the result of the torn medial meniscus as discussed under question number one.\n\nQUESTION:  In addition, if you find the condition exists, are there non-occupational activities or intervening injuries, which could have contributed to Xxxxx's condition?\n\nANSWER: No.  He does not give any history of any intervening injuries.\n\nIf you opine the requested condition should be additionally recognized, please include the condition as an allowed condition in the discussion of the following questions.\n\nQUESTION:  Based on the objective findings is the request for 10 sessions of physical therapy per C-9 dated July 27, 2007, medically necessary and appropriate for the allowed conditions of the claim of osteoarthritis of left knee?\n\nANSWER:  Yes.

The patient is currently NPO with G-tube to meet all of his hydration and nutritional needs.  A trial of Passy-Muir valve was completed to allow the patient to achieve hands-free voicing.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nThe patient is a 60-year-old male, who self-reported history of head and neck cancer status post 35 radiation treatments and 6 weeks of chemotherapy between March 2008 and July 2008.  The patient was referred for an outpatient speech and language pathology consult to increase speech and swallowing abilities.  The patient is currently NPO with G-tube to meet all of his hydration and nutritional needs.  He has been NPO since April 2008.  The patient also has a trach, which she is currently using finger occlusion to achieve voicing.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Lortab.\n\nPREVIOUS MEDICAL HISTORY:  Cardiac stent in 2000.\n\nPATIENT'S GOAL:  To eat again by mouth.\n\nSTUDY:  A trial of Passy-Muir valve was completed to allow the patient to achieve hands-free voicing and also to improve his secretion management.  A clinical swallow evaluation was not completed due to the severity of the patient's mucus and lack of saliva control.\n\nThe patient's laryngeal area was palpated during a dry swallow and he does have significantly reduced laryngeal elevation and radiation fibrosis.  The further evaluate of his swallowing function is safety; a modified barium swallow study needs to be concluded to objectively evaluate his swallow safety, and to rule out aspiration.  A trial of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy was completed to determine if this therapy protocol will be beneficial and improving the patient's swallowing function and safety.\n\nFor his neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy, the type was BMR with a single mode cycle time is 4 seconds and 12 seconds off with frequency was 60 __________ with a ramp of 2 seconds, phase duration was 220 with an output of 99 milliamps.  Electrodes were placed on the suprahyoid/submandibular triangle with an upright body position, trial length was 10 minutes.  On a pain scale, the patient reported no pain with the electrical stimulation therapy.\n\nFINDINGS:  The patient was able to tolerate a 5-minute placement of the Passy-Muir valve.  He reported no discomfort on the inhalation; however, he felt some resistance on exhalation.  Instructions were given on care placement and cleaning of the Passy-Muir valve.  The patient was instructed to buildup tolerance over the next several days of his Passy-Muir valve and to remove the valve at anytime or he is going to be sleeping or napping throughout the day.  The patient's voicing did improve with the Passy-Muir valve due to decreased leakage from his trach secondary to finger occlusion.  Mucus production also seemed to decrease when the Passy-Muir was placed.\n\nOn the dry swallow during this evaluation, the patient's laryngeal area is reduced and tissues around his larynx and showed radiation fibrosis.  The patient's neck range of motion appears to be adequate and within normal limits.\n\nA trial of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy:\nThe patient tolerating the neuromuscular electrical stimulation, we did achieve poor passive response, but these muscles were contracting and the larynx was moving upon stimulation.  The patient was able to actively swallow with stimulation approximately 30% of presentation.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  The patient with a history of head and neck cancer status post radiation and chemotherapy with radiation fibrosis, which is impeding his swallowing abilities.  The patient would benefit from outpatient skilled speech therapy for neuromuscular electrical stimulation for muscle reeducation to improve his swallowing function and safety and he would benefit from a placement of a Passy-Muir valve to have hands-free communication.\n\nPLAN OF CARE:  Outpatient skilled speech therapy two times a week to include neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy, Passy-Muir placement and a completion of the modified barium swallow study.\n\nSHORT-TERM GOALS (6 WEEKS):\n1.  Completion of modified barium swallow study.\n2.  The patient will coordinate volitional swallow with greater than 75% of the neuromuscular electrical stimulations.\n3.  The patient will increase laryngeal elevation by 50% for airway protection.\n4.  The patient will tolerate placement of Passy-Muir valve for greater than 2 hours during awaking hours.\n5.  The patient will tolerate therapeutic feedings with the speech and language pathologist without signs and symptoms of aspiration.\n6.  The patient will decrease mild facial restrictions to the anterior neck by 50% to increase laryngeal movement.\n\nLONG-TERM GOALS (8 WEEKS):\n1.  The patient will improve secretion management to tolerable levels.\n2.  The patient will increase amount and oral consistency of p.o. intake tolerated without signs and symptoms of aspirations.\n3.  The patient will be able to communicate without using finger occlusion with the assistance of a Passy-Muir valve.

The injured worker does state that he was working as a processor for the ABCD Company on July 18, 2007, when he injured his left knee.  He does state he was working in a catwalk when he stepped up.  He noticed his sight glass was not open on the tank.  He then stepped straight down and his knee went sideways.  His knee popped and he sat down secondary to discomfort.  At that time he could not do any type of activity secondary to the pain.  The nurse called the ambulance subsequent to this injury and he was taken to Bethesda North.  X-rays were obtained which demonstrated no evidence of fracture.  Thereafter, he was referred to X who he saw on July 19, 2007.  It was felt that a MRI scan about the knee needed to be obtained and it was obtained on July 24.  It was noted that there was evidence of an anterior cruciate ligament tear and a slight medial meniscal tear.  On his second visit, it was felt that arthroscopic surgery intervention was indicated as related to the left knee.\n\nOn September 7, 2007, he underwent surgical intervention at ABC for the anterior cruciate reconstruction as well as the partial medial meniscectomy.\n\nAt the present time, he is progressing along with physical therapy.  He is utilizing one crutch.\n\nHe does admit to significant bruising and swelling about the left lower extremity.  If he does indeed move too fast, the discomfort is increased.  His pain about the left knee is approximately 6 to 7 on a scale of 1 to 10.\n\nHe has had injuries to the right knee in which he wrecked his bicycle and did have some type of fracture bone spur when he was 13 years of age.\n\nHe underwent arthroscopic surgery as related to the right knee at that time and really did quite well.\n\nHis next appointment with Dr. X is on October 4, 2007.\n\nThe injured worker denies any previous history of similar problems as related to the left knee.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Glucophage, Lipitor, Actos, Benicar, glimepiride, and Januvia.\n\nSURGICAL HISTORY:  Arthroscopic surgery of the left knee and arthroscopic surgery of the right knee.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies alcohol consumption.  He does smoke approximately one and a half packs of cigarettes per day.  His education is that of 12th grade.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is a healthy appearing 34-year-old male who is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 285 pounds.  He does not appear to be in distress at this time.  Examination is limited to the left knee.  One could appreciate a healed scar as related to the inferior pole inferior to the patella.  There are healed arthroscopic scars as well.  The range of motion of left knee reveals 50 to 70 degrees of flexion.  There is evidence of medial and lateral joint line discomfort.  Anterior Lachman's admin was negative.  No evidence of atrophy is noted.  There is weakness with aggressive function about the quadriceps and hamstring musculature.\n\nThe patient is ambulating with one crutch at this time.\n\nThere is mild degree of swelling as related to the left knee.  Deep tendon reflexes are +2/+2 bilaterally symmetrical.  Sensory examination was normal as related to the foot, but abnormal as related to the left knee.\n\nI did review pictures that were taken at the time of the surgery, which demonstrates the meniscectomy and the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.\n\nMEDICAL RECORDS REVIEW:\n1.  July 18, 2007, x-rays of the left knee demonstrated evidence of a small suprapatellar joint effusion.  It should be noted that the exam demonstrated evidence of medial and lateral joint line discomfort.  There was specific mention of intraarticular effusion.\n2.  On July 27, 2007, MRI scan of the left knee was obtained, which demonstrated evidence of the complete tear of the mid to distal ACL.  Findings suggestive of a chronic injury.  Grade I sprain of the MCL was noted.  Contusion __________ plateau medial femoral condyle and lateral femoral condyle was noted.  There was evidence of a small peripheral longitudinal tear of the posterior horn of medial meniscus.  Chondromalacia of the lateral femoral condyle and patella was noted.  It should be noted that the changes of degeneration of the cartilages of the injured worker's knee and the chronic anterior cruciate ligament changes were noted related to the July 18, 2007, injury.\n3.  July 18, 2007, first report of injury, occupational disease, and/or death.\n4.  Evaluations of ABCD Hospital.  It should be noted that the mechanism of injury was such that he was walking down the stairs when his left knee locked up.\n5.  July 18, 2007, x-rays of the left knee were obtained, which demonstrated the evidence of no acute fracture or significant osteoarthritis.  There is evidence there maybe a small suprapatellar joint effusion.\n6.  Notes from the office of Dr. X. It should be noted on physical examination his range of motion is 8 to 20 degrees.\n7.  Physical therapy prescription for __________ Orthopedics and Sports Medicine Corporation.\n8.  August 10, 2007, requests for arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon.\n9.  Physician narrative of August 24, 2007.  It is noted that the injured worker did indeed have evidence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.  His BMI was 42.  This was felt __________ pre-injury MRI scan.\n\nFollowing your review of the medical information and your physical examination, please answer the following questions as these pertain to the allowed conditions.  Please express your opinion based upon a reasonable degree of medical probability.\n\nQUESTION: Mr. XXXXXX has filed an application for the additional allowance of left knee tear of the medial meniscus and left knee ACL tear.\n\nBased on the current objective findings, mechanism of injury, or and medical records or diagnosis studies, does the medical evidence support the existence of any of the requested conditions.\n\nANSWER: The MRI sustains and verifies that these conditions do indeed exist subsequent to the injury of July 18, 2007.\n\nQUESTION: If you find any of these conditions exist, are they a direct and proximate result of the July 18, 2007, injury.\n\nANSWER: There is mention of degeneration as related to the knee prior to this episode.  This is not surprising considering the individual's weight.  There is no question degeneration as related to anterior cruciate ligament and the meniscus has been occurring for a lengthy period of time.  There has been an aggravation of this condition.  Without having a MRI to review prior to this injury, I believe, it would be safe to assume that there has been aggravation of a pre-existing condition as related to the left knee and __________ meniscal and anterior cruciate ligament pathology.  Thus there is definitely evidence of an aggravation of a pre-existing condition but not necessarily a direct and proximate result of the July 18, 2007, injury.\n\nQUESTION: Do you find Mr. XXXXXX's injury or disability was caused by natural deterioration of tissue, an organ or part of the body?\n\nANSWER: There is no question that there is a contribution of the natural deterioration of the anterior cruciate ligament as well as the medial meniscus based up on the morbid obesity that was indeed present.  Not everyone who is morbidly obese __________ any type of physical activity is more likely to have a natural deterioration of the meniscus and ligament.\n\nQUESTION: In addition, if you find that any of the requested conditions exist, are there non-occupational activities or intervening injuries that have contributed to Mr. XXXXXX's condition?\n\nANSWER: There is no question that the requested conditions do indeed exit.  Activities of daily living can very much be the culprit with regards to the cause of the difficulty that is indeed present.  It does not seem that there was a very high velocity injury that is going to cause a combination of meniscal and anterior cruciate ligament tear.\n\nThis information is based upon review of the medical records and independent medical examination performed.  If you have any further questions as related to this evaluation, please feel free to contact my office.

The patient states that her husband has been diagnosed with high blood cholesterol as well.  She wants some support with some dietary recommendations to assist both of them in healthier eating.  The two of them live alone now, and she is used to cooking for large portions.  She is having a hard time adjusting to preparing food for the two of them.  She would like to do less food preparation, in fact.  She is starting a new job this week.\n\nOBJECTIVE:  Her reported height is 5 feet 4 inches.  Today s weight was 170 pounds.  BMI is approximately 29.  A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on a 1200 calorie meal plan emphasizing low-saturated fat sources with moderate amounts of sodium as well.  Information on fast food eating was supplied, and additional information on low-fat eating was also supplied.\n\nASSESSMENT:  The patient s basal energy expenditure is estimated at 1361 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirement for weight maintenance is estimated at 1759 calories a day.  Her diet history reflects that she is making some very healthy food choices on a regular basis.  She does emphasize a lot of fruits and vegetables, trying to get a fruit or a vegetable or both at most meals.  She also is emphasizing lower fat selections.  Her physical activity level is moderate at this time.  She is currently walking for 20 minutes four or five days out of the week but at a very moderate pace with a friend.  We reviewed the efforts at weight reduction identifying 3500 calories in a pound of body fat and the need to gradually and slowly chip away at this number on a long-term basis for weight reduction.  We discussed the need to reduce calories from what her current patterns are and to hopefully increase physical activity slightly as well.  We discussed menu selection, as well as food preparation techniques.  The patient appears to have been influenced by the current low-carb, high-protein craze and had really limited her food selections based on that.  I was able to give her some more room for variety including some moderate portions of potatoes, pasta and even on occasion breading her meat as long as she prepares it in a low-fat fashion which was discussed.\n\nPLAN:  Recommend the patient increase the intensity and the duration of her physical activity with a goal of 30 minutes five days a week working at a brisk walk.  Recommend the patient reduce calories by 500 daily to support a weight loss of one pound a week.  This translates into a 1200-calorie meal plan.  I encouraged the patient to keep food records in order to better track calories consumed.  I recommended low fat selections and especially those that are lower in saturated fats.  Emphasis would be placed on moderating portions of meat and having more moderate snacks between meals as well.  This was a one-hour consultation.  I provided my name and number should additional needs arise.

The patient developed shooting pain about the right upper extremity into his hand from his elbow down to the hand.  Any type of rotation and pulling muscle did cause numbness of the middle, ring, and small finger.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nALLOWED CONDITIONS:  Lateral epicondylitis, right elbow\n\nEMPLOYER:  ABCD\n\nREQUESTED ALLOWANCE:  Carpal tunnel syndrome right.\n\nMr. XXXX is a 41-year-old male employed by ABCD as a car disassembler to make Hurst Limousines injured his right elbow on September 11, 2007, while stripping cars.  He does state he was employed for such company for the last five years.  His work includes lots of pulling, pushing, and working in weird angles.  He does state on the date of injury, he was not doing anything additional.\n\nTREATMENT HISTORY:  Thereafter, he developed shooting pain about the right upper extremity into his hand from his elbow down to the hand.  Any type of rotation and pulling muscle did cause numbness of the middle, ring, and small finger.  He was initially seen by Dr. X on October 18, 2007, at the Occupational Health Facility.  He utilized a tennis elbow brace, but did continue to experience symptomatology into the middle, ring, and small finger.  He was placed on light duty for the next couple of months.  Mr. XXXX suffered another work injury to the right shoulder on October 11, 2007.  He did undergo arthroscopic rotator cuff repair by Dr. Y in December of 2007.  Thereafter, he continued to work in a light duty type of basis for the next few months.\n\nAn EMG and nerve conduction study was performed in December of 2008, which demonstrated evidence of carpal tunnel syndrome.  He was able to return to work doing more of a light duty type of position.\n\nThe injured worker has also seen Dr. Y once again subsequent to the EMG and nerve conduction study on December 3, 2008.  It was felt that the injured worker would benefit from decompression of the carpal tunnel and an ulnar nerve transposition.  The injured worker subsequently was placed in a no work status thereafter.\n\nAt the present time, the injured worker does complain of light tingling into the small, ring, and middle finger.  There are times when the whole hand becomes very numb.  He does not use and do any type of lifting with regards to the right hand secondary to the discomfort.  His pain does vary between a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10.  He denies any weakness.  He does not awaken at night with the symptomatology.  Doing his job is the only causation as related to the carpal tunnel syndrome and the cubital tunnel type symptoms.  He does state that he is right-handed.\n\nIn addition, he does note numbness and tingling as related to the left hand.  He has not had any type of EMG and nerve conduction study as related to the left upper extremity.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  None.\n\nALLERGIES:  Zyrtec.\n\nSURGERIES:  Left shoulder surgery.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The injured worker denies tobacco or alcohol consumption.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Healthy-appearing 41-year-old male, who is 5 feet 8 inches, weighs 205 pounds.  He does not appear to be in distress at this time.\n\nOn examination of the right upper extremity, one can appreciate no evidence of swelling, discoloration or ecchymosis.  The range of motion of the right wrist reveals flexion is 50 degrees, dorsiflexion 60 degrees, ulnar deviation 30 degrees, radial deviation 20 degrees.  Tinel's and Phalen's tests were positive.  Reverse Phalen's admin was negative.  There is diminished sensation in distribution of the thumb, index, middle, and ring finger.  The intrinsic function did appear to be intact.  The injured worker does not demonstrate any evidence of difficulties as related to extension of the middle, ring, and index finger as related to the elbow.  The range of motion of the right elbow reveals flexion 140 degrees, extension 0 degrees, pronation and supination 80 degrees.  Tinel's admin is negative as related to the elbow and the ulnar nerve.\n\nThere is noted to be satisfactory strength as related to major motor groups of the right upper extremity.\n\nRECORDS REVIEW:  \n1.  First report of injury, difficulty as related to both hands.\n2.  Number of notes of Occupational Health Clinic.  It was felt that the injured worker did indeed suffer from median nerve entrapment at the wrist and ulnar nerve entrapment at the right elbow with the associated right lateral epicondylitis.\n3.  December 20, 2007, operative note of Dr. Y.  At which time, the injured worker underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, subacromial decompression, partial synovectomy of the anterior compartment, limited debridement of the partial superior-sided subscapularis tear without evidence of subacromial impingement.\n4.  November 17, 2008, EMG and nerve conduction study, which demonstrated moderate right median neuropathy plus carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\nASSESSMENT:  Please state your opinion for the following questions based upon your review of the enclosed medical records on January 23, 2009, examination of the claimant.\n\nPlease indicate whether the restriction given on December 3, 2008, is the result of the allowed condition of lateral epicondylitis.\n\nIt should be noted on physical examination that the symptomatology as related to the lateral epicondylitis have very much resolved as of January 23, 2009.  Resisted extension of the middle finger and wrist do not cause any pain about the lateral epicondylar region.  It also should be noted that really there is no significant weakness as related to the function of the right upper extremity.  Also noted is there is an absence of tenderness as related to the lateral epicondylar region.\n\nQUESTION:  Has the claimant reached maximum medical improvement for the allowed conditions of lateral epicondylitis? Please explain.\n\nANSWER:  Based upon the examination on January 23, 2009, the injured worker has indeed reached maximum medical improvement as related to the diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis.  This is based upon review of the medical records, evidence-based medicine, and the Official Disability Guidelines.\n\nQUESTION:  Please indicate whether the allowed condition of lateral epicondylitis has temporarily and totally disabled the claimant from December 8, 2008 through February 1, 2009, and continuing.  Please explain.\n\nANSWER:  There is insufficient medical evidence and it is my opinion to state that the allowed condition of lateral epicondylitis is not temporarily and totally disabling the claimant from December 8, 2008 through February 1, 2009, and continuing.  As mentioned the symptomatology referable to the lateral epicondylar region has very much resolved based upon the examination performed on January 23, 2009.\n\nQUESTION:  If it is your opinion that the claimant is temporarily and totally disabled due to allowed condition of lateral epicondylitis, please indicate what treatment the claimant must undergo in order to achieve a plateau of maximum medical improvement.  Please also give an estimated time for maximum medical improvement.\n\nANSWER:  The injured worker has indeed reached maximum medical improvement as related to the elbow.  There is no question that the injured worker is not temporarily and totally disabled due to the allowed condition of lateral epicondylitis.  At the time of the exam, the injured worker has indeed reached maximum medical improvement as related to lateral epicondylitis as described previously.\n\nQUESTION:  Is the claimant suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome, right?\n\nANSWER:  The claimant does suffer from the condition of carpal tunnel syndrome, right.  This is very much based upon the EMG and nerve conduction study obtained on October 17, 2008.\n\nQUESTION:  If the claimant does suffer from the condition of carpal tunnel syndrome, right, is it the result of his September 11, 2007, work injury?\n\nANSWER:  It is my opinion, it does appear based upon the symptomatology of September 11, 2007, approximately one day subsequent to the date of injury that the injured worker did indeed have evidence of symptomatology referable to the index, middle, and ring finger very much compatible to carpal tunnel syndrome.  Thus the condition of carpal tunnel syndrome, right, is not the direct and proximate result of the September 11, 2007, work injury.\n\nQUESTION:   If it is your opinion that the claimant suffers from carpal tunnel syndrome, right, as a result of his work injury, please indicate whether you believe the claimant is capable to returning to his former position of employment with or without restrictions.  If the claimant has restrictions, please detail what they are?\n\nANSWER:  It is my opinion that the claimant does indeed suffer from right carpal tunnel syndrome.  There is no question this is very much based upon the overactivity as related to utilization of the right wrist and hand.  The claimant is capable to return to his former position of employment.  He indeed very much needs to avoid those activities that cause pain as related to utilization of the right upper extremity.\n\nQUESTION:  If it is your opinion that the claimant is temporarily and totally disabled due to carpal tunnel syndrome, right, please indicate what treatment the claimant must undergo in order to achieve a plateau of maximum medical improvement.  Please be sure to indicate the estimated length of time for the claimant to achieve a plateau of maximum medical improvement.\n\n ANSWER:  Based upon review of the independent medical examination and review of the symptomatology that the injured worker would benefit from surgical intervention as related to the right elbow.  Determination needs to be made whether or not to proceed with the decompression of both the ulnar and median nerve based upon this exam.  This determination needs to be rendered about the need for surgical intervention as related to the right wrist and hand.\n\nThis information is based upon review of the medical records and independent medical examination performed.  If you have any further questions as related to the evaluation, please feel free to contact my office.

Although this has been a very successful treatment in terms of her febrile seizure control, she is now having occasional brief periods of pauses and staring, where she becomes unresponsive, but does not lose her postural tone.  The typical spell according to dad last anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds, mom says 3 to 4 minutes, which likely means probably somewhere in the 30- to 40-second period of time.  Mom did note that an episode had happened outside of a store recently, was associated with some perioral cyanosis, but there has never been a convulsive activity noted.  There have been no recent changes in her Keppra dosing and she is currently only at 20 mg/kg per day, which is overall a low dose for her.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Born at 36 weeks' gestation by C-section delivery at 8 pounds 3 ounces.  She does have a history of febrile seizures and what parents reported an abdominal migraine, but on further questioning, it appears to be more of a food intolerance issue.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She has undergone no surgical procedures.\n\nFAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY:  There is a strong history of epilepsy on the maternal side of family including mom with some nonconvulsive seizure during childhood and additional seizures in maternal great grandmother and a maternal great aunt.  There is no other significant neurological history on the paternal side of the family.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Currently lives with her mom, dad, and two siblings.  She is at home full time and does not attend day care.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Clear review of 10 systems are taken and revealed no additional findings other than those mentioned in the history of present illness.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nVital Signs:  Weight was 15.6 kg.  She was afebrile.  Remainder of her vital signs were stable and within normal ranges for her age as per the medical record.\nGeneral:  She was awake, alert, and oriented.  She was in no acute distress, only slightly flustered when trying to place the EEG leads.\nHEENT:  Showed normocephalic and atraumatic head.  Her conjunctivae were nonicteric and sclerae were clear.  Her eye movements were conjugate in nature.  Her tongue and mucous membranes were moist.\nNeck:  Trachea appeared to be in the midline.\nChest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally without crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.\nCardiovascular:  Showed a normal sinus rhythm without murmur.\nAbdomen:  Showed soft, nontender, and nondistended, with good bowel sounds.  There was no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, or other masses noted on examination.\nExtremities:  Showed IV placement in the right upper extremity with appropriate restraints from the IV.  There was no evidence of clubbing, cyanosis or edema throughout.  She had no functional deformities in any of her peripheral limbs.\nNeurological:  From neurological standpoint, her cranial nerves were grossly intact throughout.  Her strength was good in the bilateral upper and lower extremities without any distal to proximal variation.  Her overall resting tone was normal.  Sensory examination was grossly intact to light touch throughout the upper and lower extremities.  Reflexes were 1+ in bilateral patella.  Toes were downgoing bilaterally.  Coordination showed accurate striking ability and good rapid alternating movements.  Gait examination was deferred at this time due to EEG lead placement.\n\nASSESSMENT:  A 2-1/2-year-old female with history of febrile seizures, now with concern for spells of unclear etiology, but somewhat concerning for partial complex seizures and to a slightly lesser extent nonconvulsive generalized seizures.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n1.  For now, we will go ahead and try to capture EEG as long as she tolerates it; however, if she would require sedation, I would defer the EEG until further adjustments to seizure medications are made and we will see her response to these medications.\n2.  As per the above, I will increase her Keppra to 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. bringing her to a total daily dose of just under 40 mg/kg per day.  If further spells are noted, we may increase upwards again to around 4.5 to 5 mL each day.\n3.  I do not feel like any specific imaging needs to be done at this time until we see her response to the medication and review her EEG findings.  EEG, hopefully, will be able to be reviewed first thing tomorrow morning; however, I would not delay discharge the patient to wait on the EEG results.  The patient has been discharged and we will contact the family as an outpatient.\n4.  The patient will need followup arrangement with me in 5 to 6 weeks' time, so we may recheck and see how she is doing and arrange for further followup then.

The patient has a long history of severe and debilitating rheumatoid arthritis for which she has had numerous treatments, but over the past ten years she has been treated with methotrexate quite successfully.  Her dosage has varied somewhere between 20 and 25 mg per week.  About the beginning of this year, her dosage was decreased from 25 mg to 20 mg, but because of the flare of the rheumatoid arthritis, it was increased to 22.5 mg per week.  She has had no problems with methotrexate as far as she knows.  She also took an NSAID about a month ago that was recently continued because of the ulcerations in her mouth.  About two weeks ago, just about the time the stomatitis began she was placed on an antibiotic for suspected upper respiratory infection.  She does not remember the name of the antibiotic.  Although she claims she remembers taking this type of medication in the past without any problems.  She was on that medication three pills a day for three to four days.  She notes no other problems with her skin.  She remembers no allergic reactions to medication.  She has no previous history of fever blisters.  \n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Reveals superficial erosions along the lips particularly the lower lips.  The posterior buccal mucosa along the sides of the tongue and also some superficial erosions along the upper and lower gingiva.  Her posterior pharynx was difficult to visualize, but I saw no erosions on the areas today.  There did however appear to be one small erosion on the soft palate.  Examination of the rest of her skin revealed no areas of dermatitis or blistering.  There were some macular hyperpigmentation on the right arm where she has had a previous burn, plus the deformities from her rheumatoid arthritis on her hands and feet as well as scars on her knees from total joint replacement surgeries.  \n\nIMPRESSION:  Erosive stomatitis probably secondary to methotrexate even though the medication has been used for ten years without any problems.  Methotrexate may produce an erosive stomatitis and enteritis after such a use. The patient also may have an enteritis that at this point may have become more quiescent as she notes that she did have some diarrhea about the time her mouth problem developed. She has had no diarrhea today, however. She has noted no blood in her stools and has had no episodes of nausea or vomiting.  \n\nI am not as familiar with the NSAID causing an erosive stomatitis.  I understand that it can cause gastrointestinal upset, but given the choice between the two, I would think the methotrexate is the most likely etiology for the stomatitis.  \n\nRECOMMENDED THERAPY: I agree with your therapeutic regimen regarding this condition with the use of prednisone and folic acid.  I also agree that the methotrexate must be discontinued in order to produce a resolution of this patients  skin problem. However, in my experience, this stomatitis may take a number of weeks to go away completely if a patient been on methotrexate, for an extended period of time, because the medication is stored within the liver and in fatty tissue.  Topically I have prescribed Lidex gel, which I find works extremely well in stomatitis conditions.  It can be applied t.i.d.  \n\nThank you very much for allowing me to share in the care of this pleasant patient.  I will follow her with you as needed.

The patient states that on Monday during routine Holt exam, it was detected by Dr. X that her heart was irregular on exam.  EKG obtained after that revealed atrial fibrillation, and subsequently the patient was started on Coumadin as well as having Toprol and referred for evaluation.  The patient states that for the last 3 years, she has had episodes of her heart racing.  It may last for minutes up to most 1 hour, and it will occasionally be related to eating a heavy meal or her caffeine or chocolate intake.  Denies dyspnea, diaphoresis, presyncope or syncope with the events, and she has had no episodes of chest pain.  They subsequently resolve on their own and do not limit her in anyway.  However, she states that for the last several years may be up to 7 years that she can recollect that she has been fatigued, and over the past couple of years, her symptoms have become more severe.  She said she can walk no more than 25 feet without becoming tired.  She states that she has to rest then her symptoms will go away, but she has been limited from that standpoint.  Denies peripheral edema, PND, orthopnea, abdominal pain, swelling, recent fever or chills.  She actually today has no complaints, and states that she has been compliant with her medications and has started taking her Coumadin as directed.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1.  Hypertension.\n2.  Myocardial infarction in 2003.\n3.  Left heart catheterization at University Hospital.\n4.  Hypercholesterolemia.\n5.  Arthritis.\n6.  CVA in 2002 and in 2003 with right eye blindness.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:\n1.  Left total knee replacement in 2002.\n2.  Left lower quadrant abscess drainage in 12/07\n\nFAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for lung and brain cancer.  There is no history that she is aware of cardiovascular disease in her family nor has any family member had sudden cardiac death.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She is retired as a cook in a school cafeteria, where she worked for 34 years.  She retired 7 years ago because of low back pain.  She used to smoke 2-1/2 packs per day for 32 years, but quit in 1995.  Denies alcohol, and denies IV or illicit drug use.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\nMEDICATIONS:\n1.  Coumadin 5 mg a day.\n2.  Toprol-XL 50 mg a day.\n3.  Aspirin 81 mg a day.\n4.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg a day.\n5.  Plendil 10 mg daily.\n6.  Lipitor 40 mg daily.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As above stating that following her stroke, she has right eye blindness, but she does have some minimal vision in her periphery.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nVITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 138/66, pulse 96, and weight 229 pounds or 104 kg.  GENERAL:  A well-developed, well-nourished, middle-aged African American female in no acute distress.  NECK:  Supple.  No JVD.  No carotid bruits.

Her rate is suboptimally controlled, we will increase her Toprol-XL to 75 mg per day.\n2.  We will obtain a transthoracic echocardiogram to evaluate her LV function as well as her valvular function.\n3.  We will check a thyroid function panel.\n4.  We will continue Coumadin as directed and to follow up with Dr. X for INR management.\n5.  Given the patient's history of a stroke in her age and recurrent atrial fibrillation, the patient should be continued on Coumadin indefinitely.\n6.  Depending upon the results of her transthoracic echocardiogram, the patient may benefit from repeat heart catheterization.  We will await results of transthoracic echocardiogram.\n7.  We will arrange for the patient to wear a Holter monitor to monitor the rate controlled on a 24-hour period.  She will then return to the electrophysiology clinic in 1 month for followup visit with Dr. Y.\n\nThe patient was seen, discussed, and examined with Dr. Y in electrophysiology.

It is not clear where this came from but it is most likely sexually transmitted.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nThank you for allowing me to help in the evaluation of the patient who, as you know, is a 44-year-old male with a history of a skin lesion for approximately one year now.  It has been given a label in the past of a skin tag.  The patient states it is not painful, has had no trauma or bleeding to that area.  The patient is interested in evaluation because he is on the move with his work and would like it taken care of.\n\nHe has no voiding complaints and no history of sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  None.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Back surgery with a fusion of L5-S1.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  He does take occasional Percocet for his back discomfort.\n\nALLERGIES:  HE HAS NO ALLERGIES.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a smoker.  He takes rare alcohol.  His employment is that he does dynamite work and actually putting in the dynamite in large holes for destroying ground to that pipeline can be laid.  He travels to anywhere for his work.  He is married with one son.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Negative for prostate cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, enlarged prostate or kidney disease.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for tremors, headaches, dizzy spells, numbness, tingling, feeling hot or cold, tired or sluggishness, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, indigestion, heartburn, fevers, chills, weight loss, wheezing, frequent cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, varicose veins, high blood pressure, skin rash, joint pain, ear infections, sore throat, sinus problems, hay fever, blood clotting problems, depressive affect or eye problems.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\nGENERAL:  The patient is afebrile.  His vital signs are stable.  He is 177 pounds, 5 feet, 8 inches.  Blood pressure 144/66.  He is healthy appearing.  He is alert and oriented x 3.\nHEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.\nLUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.\nABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.  His penis is circumcised.  He has a pedunculated cauliflower-like lesion on the dorsum of the penis at approximately 12 o'clock.  It is very obvious and apparent.  He also has a mildly raised brown lesion that the patient states has been there ever since he can remember and has not changed in size or caliber.  His testicles are descended bilaterally.  There are no masses.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is likely molluscum contagiosum (genital warts) caused by HPV.  I did state to the patient that this is likely a viral infection that could have had a long incubation period.  It is not clear where this came from but it is most likely sexually transmitted.  He is instructed that he should use protected sex from this point on in order to try and limit the transmission.  Regarding the actual lesion itself, I did mention that we could apply a cream of Condylox, which could take up to a month to work.  I also offered him C02 laser therapy for the genital warts, which is an outpatient procedure.  The patient is very interested in something quick and effective such as a CO2 laser procedure.  I did state that the recurrence rate is significant and somewhere as high as 20% despite enucleating these lesions.  The patient understood this and still wished to proceed.  There is minimal risk otherwise except for those inherent in laser injury and accidental injury.  The patient understood and wished to proceed.

She has been referred for the further evaluation of her thrombocytopenia.  This thrombocytopenia was detected on a routine blood admin performed on the 10th of June 2006.  Her hemoglobin was 13.3 with white count of 11.8 at that time.  Her lymphocyte count was 6.7.  The patient, subsequently, had a CBC repeated on the 10th at Hospital where her hemoglobin was 12.4 with a platelet count of 26,000.  She had a repeat of her CBC again on the 12th of June 2006 with hemoglobin of 14, white count of 11.6 with an increase in the number of lymphocytes.  Platelet count was 38.  Her rapid strep screen was negative but the infectious mononucleosis screen is positive.  The patient had a normal platelet count prior too and she is being evaluated for this low platelet count.\n\nThe patient gives a history of feeling generally unwell for a couple of days towards the end of May.  She was fine for a few days after that but then she had sore throat and fever 2-3 days subsequent to that.  The patient continues to have sore throat.\n\nShe denies any history of epistaxis.

She appears her stated age.  Temperature 97.9.  Pulse 84.  Blood pressure was 110/60.  Weighs 162 pounds.  Height of 61 inches.  Lungs - Normal effort.  Clear.  No wheezing.  Heart - Rate and rhythm regular.  No S3, no S4.  Abdomen - Soft.  Bowel sounds are present.  No palpable hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities - Without any edema, pallor, or cyanosis.  Neurological:  Alert and oriented x 3.  No focal deficit.  Lymph Nodes - No palpable lymphadenopathy in the neck or the axilla.  Skin examination reveals few petechiae along the lateral aspect of the left thigh but otherwise there were no ecchymotic patches.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC DATA:  The patient's CBC results from before were reviewed.  Her CBC performed in the office today showed hemoglobin of 13.7, white count of 13.3, lymphocyte count of 7.6, and platelet count of 26,000.\n\nIMPRESSION:  ITP, the patient has a normal platelet count.\n\nPLAN:\n1.  I had a long discussion with family regarding the treatment of ITP.  In view of the fact that the patient's platelet count is 26,000 and she is asymptomatic, we will continue to monitor the counts.\n2.  An ultrasound of the abdomen will be performed tomorrow.\n3.  I have given her a requisition to obtain some blood work tomorrow.

At this point, he and his wife ask about whether this is curable disease and it was difficult to inform that this was not curable disease but would be treatable.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nREASON FOR CONSULTATION:  New diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ABCD is a very nice 47-year-old gentleman without much past medical history who has now been diagnosed with a new non-small cell lung cancer stage IV metastatic disease.  We are consulted at this time to discuss further treatment options.\n\nABCD and his wife state that his history goes back to approximately 2-2-1/2 weeks ago when he developed some left-sided flank pain.  Initially, he did not think much of this and tried to go about doing work and everything else but the pain gradually worsened.  Eventually this prompted him to present to the emergency room.  A CT scan was done there, and he was found to have a large left adrenal mass worrisome for metastatic disease.  At that point, he was transferred to XYZ Hospital for further evaluation.  On admission on 12/19/08, a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was done for full staging purposes.  The CT scan of the chest showed an abnormal soft tissue mass in the right paratracheal region, extending into the precarinal region, the subcarinal region, and the right hilum.  This was causing some compression on the inferior aspect of the SVC and also some narrowing of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery.  There was an abnormal lymph node noted in the AP window and left hilar region.  There was another spiculated mass within the right upper lobe measuring 2.0 x 1.5 cm.  There was also an 8 mm non-calcified nodule noted in the posterior-inferior aspect of the left upper lobe suspicious for metastatic disease.  There were areas of atelectasis particularly in the right base.  There was also some mild ground glass opacity within the right upper lobe adjacent to the right hilum potentially representing focal area of pulmonary edema versus small infarction related to the right upper lobe pulmonary artery narrowing.  There was a small lucency adjacent to the medial aspect of the left upper lobe compatible with a small pneumothorax.  In the abdomen, there was a mass involved in the left adrenal gland as well as a nodule involving the right adrenal gland both of which appeared necrotic compatible with metastatic tumor.  All other structures appeared normal.  On 12/22/08, a CT-guided biopsy of the left adrenal mass was performed.  Pathology from this returned showing metastatic poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma.  At this point, we have been consulted to discuss further treatment options.\n\nOn further review, ABCD states that he has may be had a 20 pound weight loss over the last couple of months which he relates to anorexia or decreased appetite.  He has not ever had a chronic smoker's cough and still does not have a cough.  He has no sputum production or hemoptysis.  He and his wife are very anxious about this diagnosis.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  He denies any history of heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, liver disease, hepatitis major infection, seizure disorders or other problems.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  He denies having any surgeries.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  At home he takes no medication except occasional aspirin or ibuprofen, recently for his flank pain.  He does take a multivitamin on occasion.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  He has about a 30-pack-a-year history of smoking.  He used to drink alcohol heavily and has a history of getting a DUI about a year-and-half ago resulting in him having his truck-driving license revoked.  Since that time he has worked with printing press.  He is married and has two children, both of whom are grown in their 20s, but are now living at home.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  His mother died for alcohol-related complications.  He otherwise denies any history of cancers, bleeding disorders, clotting disorders, or other problems.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  GENERAL/CONSTITUTIONAL:  He has lost about 20 pounds of weight as described above.

RESPIRATORY:  He has had some little bit of dyspnea on exertion but otherwise denies shortness of breath at rest.  No cough, congestion, wheezing, hemoptysis, and sputum production.  CVS:  He denies any chest pains, palpitations, PND, orthopnea, or swelling of his lower extremities.  GI:  He denies any odynophagia, dysphagia, heartburn on a regular basis, abdominal pain, abdominal swelling, diarrhea, blood in his stool, or black tarry stools.  He has been somewhat constipated recently.  GU:  He denies any burning with urination, kidney stones, blood in his urine, dysuria, difficulty getting his urine out or other problems.

The differential shows 73% neutrophils, 17% lymphocytes, 7.6% monocytes, 1.9% eosinophils, and 0.7% basophils.  Chemistry shows sodium 138, potassium 3.8, chloride 104, CO2 of 31, BUN 9, creatinine 1.0, glucose 104, calcium 12.3, alkaline phosphatase 104, AST 16, ALT 12, total protein 7.6, albumin 3.5, total bilirubin 0.5, ionized calcium 1.7.  His INR is 1.0 with the PT of 11.4 and a PTT of 31.3.\n\nIMAGINING DATA:  MRI of the brain on 12/23/08 - this shows some mild white matter disease, question of minimal pontine ischemic gliosis as well as a small incidental venous angioma in the left posterior frontal deep white matter.  There is no evidence of cerebral metastasis, hemorrhage, or acute infarction.\n\nASSESSMENT/PLAN:  ABCD is a very nice 47-year-old gentleman without much past medical history, who now presents with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.  At this point, he and his wife ask about whether this is curable disease and it was difficult to inform that this was not curable disease but would be treatable.  His wife particularly had a very hard time with this prognosis.  They preferred not to know the exact average as to how long someone lives with this disease.  I did offer chemotherapy as a way to treat this disease.  Chemotherapy has been associated both with palliation of symptoms as well as prolong survival.  At this point, he has an excellent functional status and I think he would tolerate chemotherapy quite well.\n\nIn terms of chemotherapy, I talked briefly about the side affects including but not limited to GI upset, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, mucositis, fatigue, loss of appetite, low blood counts including the possible need for transfusion as well as the risk of infections, which in some rare cases can be fatal.  I would likely use carboplatin and gemcitabine.  This would be both medications given on day 1 with a dose of gemcitabine on day 8.  This cycle will be repeated after 1-week break so that the cycle lasts 21 days.  The goal will be to complete 6 cycles of this as long as he is responding and tolerating the medication.\n\nIn terms of staging Mr. ABCD'S had all the appropriate staging.  A PET-CT scan could be done, but at this point would not provide much mean full information beyond the CT scans that we have.\n\nAt this point, his biggest issue is pain and he is getting a pain consult to help control his pain.  He will be ready to be discharged from the hospital once his pain is under better control.  As this is the holiday weekend, I do not have a way of scheduling a followup appointment with them, but I did give he and his wife my card and instructed them to call on Monday.  At that point, we will get him in and I will also begin working on making arrangements for his chemotherapy.\n\nThank you very much for this interesting consult.

Mild organic brain syndrome, presumably secondary to her chronic inhalant, paint, abuse.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 53-year-old widowed woman, she lives at ABC Hotel.  She presented with a complaint of chest pain, evaluations revealed severe aortic stenosis.  She has been refusing cardiac catheter and she may well need aortic valve replacement.  She states that she does not want heart surgery or valve replacement.  She has a history of bipolar disorder and has been diagnosed at times with schizophrenia.  She is on Depakote 500 mg three times a day and Geodon 80 mg twice a day.  The patient receives mental health care through the XYZ Health System and there is a psychiatrist who makes rounds at the ABC Hotel.  She denies hallucinations, psychosis, paranoia, and suicidal ideation at this time.  States that she does not want surgery because the chest pain that was a presenting complaint has gone away that she did not feel her problem is severe enough to require surgery, and medical records does show in this obese individual that cardiac surgery would present substantial risks and for this individual with the chronic mental illness and behavioral problems of a chronic nature, surgery does present some additional risks.  The patient notes that she has a long history of substance abuse, primarily inhalation of paint vapors that she had more than 100 incarcerations in the XYZ County Jail related to offenses related to her lifestyle at that time such as shoplifting, violation of orders to abstain from substance abuse and the longest confinement of these was 100 days.\n\nThe patient is able to write a fairly reasonable explanation for why she does not want to pursue medical care.\n\nPAST AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY:  She was born in XYZ.  She is a high-school graduate from ABCD High School.  She did have an abusive childhood.  She is married four times.  She notes she developed depression when a number of her children died.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  \nGENERAL:  This is an obese woman in bed.  She is somewhat restless and moving during the interview.\nVITAL SIGNS:  Temperature of 97.3, pulse 70, respirations 18, blood pressure 113/68, and oxygen saturation 94% on 3 L of oxygen.\nPSYCHIATRY:  Speech is normal, rate, volume, grammar, and vocabulary consistent with her educational level.  There is no overt thought disorder.  She does not appear psychotic.  She is not suicidal on formal testing.  She gives the date as Sunday, 05/19/2007 when it is the 20th and 207 when it is 2007.  She is oriented to place.  She can memorize four times, repeats two at five minutes, gets the other two with category hints, this places short-term memory in normal limits.  She had difficulty with serial three subtractions, counting on her fingers and had difficulty naming the months in reverse order stating, &quot;December, November, September, October, June, July, August, September,&quot; but recognizes this was not right and then said, &quot;March, April, May.&quot;  She is able to name objects appropriately.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Chest x-ray showing no acute changes.  Carotid duplex shows no stenosis.  Electrolytes and liver function tests are normal.  TSH normal.  Hematocrit 31%.  Triglycerides 152.\n\nDIAGNOSES:  \n1.  Bipolar disorder, apparently stable on medications.\n2.  Mild organic brain syndrome, presumably secondary to her chronic inhalant, paint, abuse.\n3.  Aortic stenosis.\n4.  Sleep apnea.\n5.  Obesity.\n6.  Anemia.\n7.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:  It is my impression at present that the patient retains ability to make decisions on her own behalf.  Given this lady's underlying mental problems, I would recommend that her treating physicians discuss her circumstances with physicians who round on her at the ABC Hotel.  While she may well need surgery and cardiac catheter, she may be more willing to accept this in the context of some continued encouragement from care providers who usually provide care for her.  She clearly at this time wants to leave this hospital; she normally gets her care through XYZ Health.  Again, in summary, I would consider her to retain the ability to make decisions on her own behalf.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me at digital pager if additional information is needed.

She formerly worked for Veteran's Home as a CNA.  She has had a long drawn out course of treatment for this shoulder.  She tried physical therapy without benefit and ultimately came to a subacromion decompression in November 2002.  She had ongoing pain and was evaluated by Dr. X who felt that she had a possible brachial plexopathy.  He also felt she had a right superficial radial neuritis and blocked this with resolution of her symptoms.  He then referred her to ABCD who did EMG testing, demonstrating a right suprascapular neuropathy although a C5 radiculopathy could not be ruled out.  MRI testing on the cervical spine was then done which was negative for disk herniation and she underwent suprascapular nerve decompression of the scapular notch on 12/18/03.  She finally went to an anterior axillary nerve block because of ongoing pain in the anterior shoulder again by Dr. X.  She comes to me for impairment rating.  She has no chronic health problems otherwise, fevers, chills, or general malaise.  She is not working.  She is right-hand dominant.  She denies any prior history of injury to her shoulder.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Negative aside from above.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Please see above.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative aside from above.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  A pleasant, age appropriate woman, moderately overweight, in no apparent distress.  Normal gait and station, normal posture, normal strength, tone, sensation and deep tendon reflexes with the exception of 4+/5 strength in the supraspinatus musculature on the right.  She has decreased motion in the right shoulder as follows.  She has 160 degrees of flexion, 155 degrees of abduction, 35 degrees of extension, 25 degrees of adduction, 45 degrees of internal rotation and 90 degrees of external rotation.  She has a positive impingement sign on the right.\n\nASSESSMENT:  Right shoulder impingement syndrome, right suprascapular neuropathy.\n\nDISCUSSION:  With a reasonable degree of medical certainty, she is at maximum medical improvement and she does have an impairment based on AMA Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition.  The reason for this impairment is the incident of 01/01/02.  For her suprascapular neuropathy, she is rated as a grade IV motor deficit which I rate as a 13% motor deficit.  This is multiplied by a maximum upper extremity impairment for involvement of the suprascapular nerve of 16% which produces a 2% impairment of the upper extremity when the two values are multiplied together, 2% impairment of the upper extremity.  For her lack of motion in the shoulder she also has additional impairment on the right.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder flexion.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder abduction.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder adduction.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder extension.  There is no impairment for findings in shoulder external rotation.  She has a 3% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder internal rotation.  Thus the impairment due to lack of motion in her shoulder is a 6% impairment of the upper extremity.  This combines with the 2% impairment of the upper extremity due to weakness in the suprascapular nerve root distribution to produce an 8% impairment of the upper extremity which in turn is a 5% impairment of the whole person based on the AMA Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition, stated with a reasonable degree of medical certainty.

The patient has had increasing depression and has been under stress as a result of dissolution of her second marriage.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 41-year-old registered nurse (R.N.).  She was admitted following an overdose of citalopram and warfarin.  The patient has had increasing depression and has been under stress as a result of dissolution of her second marriage.  She notes starting in January, her husband of five years seemed to be quite withdrawn.  It turned out, he was having an affair with one of her best friends and he subsequently moved in with this woman.  The patient is distressed, as over the five years of their marriage, she has gotten herself into considerable debt supporting him and trying to find a career that would work for him.  They had moved to ABCD where he had recently been employed as a restaurant manager.  She also moved her mother and son out there and is feeling understandably upset that he was being dishonest and deceitful with her.  She has history of seasonal affective disorder, winter depressions, characterized by increased sleep, increased irritability, impatience, and fatigue.  Some suggestion on her part that her father may have had some mild bipolar disorder and including the patient has a cyclical and recurrent mood disorder.  In January, she went on citalopram.  She reports since that time, she has lost 40 pounds of weight, has trouble sleeping at night, thinks perhaps her mood got worse on the citalopram, which is possible, though it is also possible that the progressive nature of getting divorce than financial problems has contributed to her worsening mood.\n\nPAST AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY:  She was born in XYZ.  She describes the family as being somewhat dysfunctional.  Father was a truckdriver.  She is an only child.  She reports that she had a history of anorexia and bulimia as a teenager.  In her 20s, she served six years in Naval Reserve.  She was previously married for four years.  She described that as an abusive relationship.  She had a history of being in counseling with ABC, but does not think this therapist, who is now by her estimate 80 years old, is still in practice.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  \nGENERAL:  This is an alert and cooperative woman.\nVITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.1, pulse 60, respirations 18, blood pressure 95/54, oxygen saturation 95%, and weight is 132.\nPSYCHIATRIC:  She makes good eye contact.  Speech is normal in rate, volume, grammar, and vocabulary.  There is no thought disorder.  She denies being suicidal.  Her affect is appropriate for material being discussed.  She has a sense of future, wants to get back to work, has plans to return to counseling.  She appeared to have normal orientation, concentration, memory, and judgment.\n\nMedical history is notable for factor V Leiden deficiency, history of pulmonary embolus, restless legs syndrome.  She has been off her Mirapex.  I did encourage her to go back on the Mirapex, which would likely lead to some improvement in mood by facilitating better sleep.\n\nThe patient at this time can contract for safety.  She has made plans for outpatient counseling this Saturday and we will get a referral to a psychiatrist for which she is agreeable to following up with.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  INR, which is still 8.8.  In 1998, she had a normal MRI.  Electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, and CBC were all normal.\n\nDIAGNOSES:  \n1.  Seasonal depressive disorder.\n2.  Restless legs syndrome.\n3.  Overdose of citalopram and warfarin.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:  The patient reports she has been feeling better since discontinuing antidepressants.  I, therefore, recommend she stay off antidepressants at present.  If needed, she can take Prozac, which has been effective for her in the past and she plans to see a psychiatrist for consultation.  She does give a fairly good history of seasonal depression and given that her mood has improved in the past with Prozac, this will be an appropriate agent to try as needed in the future, but given the situational nature of the depression, she primarily appears to need counseling.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me at digital pager if there is additional information I can provide.

Past ocular history includes cataract extraction with lens implants in both eyes.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nMs. ABC is an 87-year-old white female who presented to the Cornea Clinic today for a one-week history of decreased vision in the left eye.\n\nShe has a past ocular history including cataract extraction with lens implants in both eyes in 2001 and 2003.  She also has a history of glaucoma diagnosed in 1990 and macular degeneration.  She has been followed in her home country and is here visiting family.  She had the above-mentioned observation and was brought in on an urgent basis today.\n\nHer past medical history includes hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and hypothyroidism.\n\nHer medications include V-optic 0.5% eye drops to both eyes twice a day and pilocarpine 2% OU three times a day.  She took both the drops this morning.  She also takes Eltroxin which is for hypothyroidism, Plendil for blood pressure, and pravastatin.\n\nShe is allergic to Cosopt.\n\nShe has a family history of blindness in her brother as well as glaucoma and hypertension.\n\nHer visual acuity today at distance without correction are 20/25 in the right and count fingers at 3 feet in the left eye.  Manifest refraction showed no improvement in either eye.  The intraocular pressures by applanation were 7 on the right and 18 in the left eye.  Gonioscopy showed grade 4 open angles in both eyes.  Humphrey visual field testing done elsewhere showed diffuse reduction in sensitivity in both eyes.  The lids were normal OU.  She has mild dry eye OU.  The corneas are clear OU.  The anterior chamber is deep and quiet OU.  Irides appear normal.  The lenses show well centered posterior chamber intraocular lenses OU.\n\nDilated fundus exam shows clear vitreous OU.  The optic nerves are normal in size.  They both appear to have mild pallor.  The optic cups in both eyes are shallow.  The cup-to-disc ratio in the right eye is not overtly large, would estimated 0.5 to 0.6; however, she does have very thin rim tissue inferotemporally in the right eye.  In the left eye, the glaucoma appears to be more advanced to the larger cup-to-disc ratio and a thinner rim tissue.\n\nThe macula on the right shows drusen with focal areas of RPE atrophy.  I do not see any evidence of neovascularization such as subretinal fluid, lipid or hemorrhage.  She does have a punctate area of RPE atrophy which is just adjacent to the fovea of the right eye.  In the left eye, she has also several high-risk drusen, but no evidence of neovascularization.  The RPE in the left eye does appear to be more diffusely abnormal although these changes do appear somewhat mild.  I do not see any dense or focal areas of frank RPE atrophy or hypertrophy.\n\nThe peripheral retinas are attached in both eyes.\n\nMs. ABC has pseudophakia OU which is stable and she is doing well in this regard.  She has glaucoma which likely is worse in the left eye and also likely explains her poor vision in the left eye.  The intraocular pressure in the mid-to-high teens in the left eye is probably high for her.  She has allergic reaction to Cosopt.  I will recommend starting Xalatan OS nightly.  I think the intraocular pressure in the right eye is acceptable and is probably a stable pressure for her OD.  She will need followup in the next 1 or 2 months after returning home to Israel later this week after starting the new medication which is Xalatan.\n\nRegarding the macular degeneration, she has had high-risk changes in both eyes.  The vision in the right eye is good, but she does have a very concerning area of RPE atrophy just adjacent to the fovea of the right eye.  I strongly recommend that she see a retina specialist before returning to Israel in order to fully discuss prophylactic measures to prevent worsening of her macular degeneration in the right eye.

The adrenal lesion is a small lesion, appears as if probable benign adenoma, where as the pancreatic lesion is the cystic lesion, and neoplasm could not be excluded. \n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Both pancreatic and left adrenal lesions.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 60-year-old white male is referred to us by his medical physician with a complaint of recent finding of a both pancreatic lesion and lesions with left adrenal gland.  The patient's history dates back to at the end of the January of this past year when he began experiencing symptoms consistent with difficulty almost like a suffocating feeling whenever he would lie flat on his back.  He noticed whenever he would recline backwards, he would begin this feeling and it is so bad now that he can barely recline, very little before he has this feeling.  He is now sleeping in an upright position.  He was sent for CAT scan originally of his chest.  The CAT scan of the chest reveals a pneumonitis, but also saw a left adrenal nodule and a small pancreatic lesion.  He was subsequently was sent for a dedicated abdominal CAT scan and MRI.  The CAT scan revealed 1.8-cm lesion of his left adrenal gland, suspected to be a benign adenoma.  The pancreas showed pancreatic lesion towards the mid body tail aspect of the pancreas, approximately 1 cm, most likely of cystic nature.  Neoplasm could not be excluded.  He was referred to us for further assessment.  He denies any significant abdominal pain, any nausea or vomiting.  His appetite is fine.  He has had no significant changes in his bowel habits or any rectal bleeding or melena.  He has undergone a colonoscopy in September of last year and was found to have three adenomatous polyps.  He does have a history of frequent urination.  Has been followed by urologist for this.  There is no family history of pancreatic cancer.  There is a history of gallstone pancreatitis in the patient's sister.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, asthma, and high cholesterol.\n\nALLERGIES:  ENVIRONMENTAL.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Include glipizide 5 mg b.i.d., metformin 500 mg b.i.d., Atacand 16 mg daily, metoprolol 25 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 10 mg daily, pantoprazole 40 mg daily, Flomax 0.4 mg daily, Detrol 4 mg daily, Zyrtec 10 mg daily, Advair Diskus 100/50 mcg one puff b.i.d., and fluticasone spray 50 mcg two sprays daily.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  He has not had any previous surgery.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  His brothers had prostate cancer.  Father had brain cancer.  Heart disease in both sides of the family.  Has diabetes in his brother and sister.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a non-cigarette smoker and non-ETOH user.  He is single and he has no children.  He works as a payroll representative and previously did lot of work in jewelry business, working he states with chemical.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He denies any chest pain.  He admits to exertional shortness of breath.  He denies any GI problems as noted.  Has frequent urination as noted.  He denies any bleeding disorders or bleeding history.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nGENERAL:  Presents as an obese 60-year-old white male, who appears to be in no apparent distress.\nHEENT:  Unremarkable.\nNECK:  Supple.  There is no mass, adenopathy or bruit.\nCHEST:  Normal excursion.\nLUNGS:  Clear to auscultation and percussion.\nCOR:  Regular.  There is no S3 or S4 gallop.  There is no obvious murmur.\nHEART:  There is distant heart sounds.\nABDOMEN:  Obese.  It is soft.  It is nontender.  Examination was done as relatively sitting up as the patient was unable to recline.  Bowel sounds are present.  There is no obvious mass or organomegaly.\nGENITALIA:  Deferred.\nRECTAL:  Deferred.\nEXTREMITIES:  Revealed about 1+ pitting edema.  Bilateral peripheral pulses are intact.\nNEUROLOGIC:  Without focal deficits.  The patient is alert and oriented.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Both left adrenal and pancreatic lesions.  The adrenal lesion is a small lesion, appears as if probable benign adenoma, where as the pancreatic lesion is the cystic lesion, and neoplasm could not be excluded.  Given the location of these pancreatic lesions in the mid body towards the tail and size of 1 cm, the likelihood is an ERCP will be of no value and the likelihood is that it is too small to biopsy.  We are going to review x-rays with Radiology prior with the patient probably at some point will present for operative intervention.  Prior to that the patient will undergo an esophagogastroduodenoscopy.

The options including radical prostatectomy with or without nerve sparing were discussed with him with the risks of bleeding, infection, rectal injury, impotence, and incontinence.  These were discussed at length.  Alternative therapies including radiation therapy; either radioactive seed placement, conformal radiation therapy, or the HDR radiation treatments were discussed with the risks of bladder, bowel, and rectal injury and possible impotence were discussed also.  There is a risk of rectal fistula.  Hormonal therapy is usually added to the radiation therapy options and this has the risk of osteoporosis, gynecomastia, hot flashes and impotency.  Potency may not recover after the hormone therapy has been completed.  Cryosurgery was discussed with the risks of urinary retention, stricture formation, incontinence and impotency.  There is a risk of rectal fistula.  He would need to have a suprapubic catheter for about two weeks and may need to learn self-intermittent catheterization if he cannot void adequately.  Prostate surgery to relieve obstruction and retention after radioactive seeds or cryosurgery has a higher risk of urinary incontinence.  Observation therapy was discussed with him in addition.  I answered all questions that were put to me and I think he understands the options that are available.  I spoke with the patient for over 60 minutes concerning these options.

According to the patient, she had stable blood pressure for the past 12-15 years on 10 mg of lisinopril.  In August of 2007, she was treated with doxorubicin and, as well as Procrit and her blood pressure started to go up to over 200s.  Her lisinopril was increased to 40 mg daily.  She was also given metoprolol and HCTZ two weeks ago, after she visited the emergency room with increased systolic blood pressure.  Denies any physical complaints at the present time.  Denies having any renal problems in the past.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above plus history of anemia treated with Procrit.  No smoking or alcohol use and lives alone.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Unremarkable.\n\nPRESENT MEDICATIONS:  As above.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Cardiovascular:  No chest pain.  No palpitations.  Pulmonary:  No shortness of breath, cough, or wheezing.  Gastrointestinal:  No nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.  GU:  No nocturia.  Denies having gross hematuria.  Salt intake is minimal.  Neurological:  Unremarkable, except for history of old CVA.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure today is 182/78.  Examination of the head is unremarkable.  Neck is supple with no JVD.  Lungs are clear.  There is no abdominal bruit.  Extremities 1+ edema bilaterally.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Urinalysis done in the office shows 1+ proteinuria; same is shown by urinalysis done at Hospital.  The creatinine is 0.8.  Renal ultrasound showed possible renal artery stenosis and a 2 cm cyst in the left kidney.  MRA of the renal arteries was essentially unremarkable with no suspicion for renal artery stenosis.\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Accelerated hypertension.  No clear-cut etiology for recent worsening since renal artery stenosis was ruled out by negative MRA.  I could only blame Procrit initiation, as well as possible fluid retention as a cause of the patient's accelerated hypertension.  She was started on hydrochlorothiazide less than two weeks ago with some improvement in her hypertension.  At this point, I would not pursue a diagnosis of renal artery stenosis.  Since she is maxed out on lisinopril and her pulse is 60, I would not increase beta-blocker or ACE inhibitor.  I will continue HCTZ at 24 mg daily.  The patient was also given a sample of Tekturna, which would hopefully improve her systolic blood pressure.  The patient was told to be stick with her salt intake.  She will report to me in 10 days with the result of her blood pressure.  She will also repeat an SMA7 to rule out possible hyperkalemia due to Tekturna.

Right frontal lobe glioma.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nCC: Headache\n\nHX: 37 y/o RHF presented to her local physician with a one month history of intermittent predominantly left occipital headaches which were awakening her in the early morning hours. The headachese were dull to throbbing in character. She was initially treated with Parafon-forte for tension type headaches, but the pain did not resolve. She subsequently underwent HCT in early 12/90 which revealed a right frontal mass lesion.\n\nPMH: 1)s/p tonsillectomy. 2)s/p elective abortion.\n\nFHX: Mother with breast CA, MA with &quot;bone cancer.&quot; AODM both sides of family.\n\nSHX: Denied tobacco or illicit drug use. Rarely consumes ETOH. Married with 2 teenage children.\n\nEXAM: VItal signs unremarkable.\n\nMS: Alert and oriented to person, place, time.

Exam: unremarkable.\n\nCOURSE: MRI Brain: large solid and cystic right frontal lobe mass with a large amount of surrounding edema. There is apparent tumor extension into the corpus callosum across the midline. Tumor extension is also suggested in the anterior limb of the interanl capsule on the right. There is midline mass shift to the left with effacement of the anterior horn of the right lateral ventricle. The MRI findings are most consistent with glioblastoma.\n\nThe patient underwent right frontal lobectomy. The pathological diagnosis was xanthomatous astrocytoma. The literature at the time was not clear as to optimal treatment protocol. People have survived as long as 25 years after diagnosis with this type of tumor. XRT was deferred until 11/91 when an MRI and PET Scan suggested extension of the tumor. She then received 5580 cGy of XRT in divided segments. She developed olfactory auras shortly after lobectomy at was treated with PB with subsequent improvement. She was treated with BCNU chemotherapy protocol in 1992.

Probable brainstem glioma.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nCC: Dysarthria\n\nHX: This 52y/o RHF was transferred from a local hospital to UIHC on 10/28/94 with a history of progressive worsening of vision, dysarthria, headache, and incoordination beginning since 2/94. Her husband recalled her first difficulties became noticeable after a motor vehicle accident in 2/94. She was a belted passenger in a car struck at a stop. There was no reported head or neck injury or alteration of consciousness. She was treated and released from a local ER the same day. Her husband noted the development of mild dysarthria, incoordination, headache and exacerbation of preexisting lower back pain within 2 week of the accident. In 4/94 she developed stress urinary incontinence which spontaneously resolved in June. In 8/94, her HA changed from a dull constant aching in the bitemporal region to a sharper constant pain in the nuchal/occipital area. She also began experiencing increased blurred vision, worsening dysarthria and difficulty hand writing. In 9/94 she was evaluated by a local physician. Examination then revealed incoordination, generalized fatigue, and dysarthria. Soon after this she became poorly arousable and increasingly somnolent. She had difficulty walking and generalized weakness. On 10/14/94, she lost the ability to walk by herself. Evaluation at a local hospital revealed: 1)Normal electronystagmography, 2)two lumbar punctures which revealed some atypical mononuclear cells suggestive of &quot;tumor or reactive lymphocytosis.&quot; One of these CSF analysis showed: Glucose 16, Protein 99, WBC 14, RBC 114. Echocardiogram was normal. Bone marrow biopsy was normal except for decreased iron. Abdominal-Pelvic CT scan, CXR, Mammogram, PPD, ANA, TFT, and RPR were unremarkable. A 10/31/94 MRI brain scan a 5x10mm area of increased signal on T2 weighted images in the right remporal lobe lateral to the anterior aspect of the temporal horn, right posterolateral aspect of the midbrain, pons, and bilateral inferior surface of the cerebellum involving gray and white matter. These areas did not enhance with gadolinium contrast on T1 weighted images.\n\nMEDS: none.\n\nPMH: 1)G3P3, 2)last menses one year ago.\n\nFHX: Mother suffered stroke in her 70's. DM and Htn in family.\n\nSHX: Married, Secretary, No h/o tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use.\n\nROS: no weight loss, fever, chills, nightsweats, cough, dysphagia.\n\nEXAM: BP139/74, HR 90, RR20, 36.8C\n\nMS: Drowsy to somnolent, occasionally &quot;giddy.&quot; Oriented to person, place, time. Minimal dysarthric speech, but appropriate. MMSE 27/30 (copy of exam not in chart).\n\nCN: Pupils 4/4 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light. Optic disks were flat and without sign of papilledema. VFFTC. EOM intact. No nystagmus. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable.\n\nMotor: 5/5 strength throughout. Normal muscle tone and bulk.\n\nSensory: No deficit to LT/PP/VIB/PROP.\n\nCoord: difficulty with RAM in BUE, and ataxia on FNF and HKS in all extremities.\n\nStation: Romberg sign present.\n\nGait: unsteady, wide-based, with notable difficulty on TW, TT and HW.\n\nReflexes: 2/2 BUE, 0/1 patellae, trace at both archilles, Plantars responses were flexor, bilaterally.\n\nGen Exam: unremarkable.\n\nCOURSE: CSF analysis by lumbar puncture, 10/31/94: Protein 131mg/dl (normal 15-45), Albumin 68 (normal 14-20), IgG10mg/dl (normal &lt;6.2), IgG index -O.1mg/24hr (normal),\n\nNo oligoclonal bands seen, WBC 33 (19lymphocytes, 1 neutrophil), RBC 29, Glucose 13, Cultures (bacteria, fungal, AFB) were negative, crytococcal Ag negative. The elevated CSF total protein, IgG, and albumin suggested breakdown of the blood brain barrier or blockage of CSF flow. The normal IgG synthesis rate and lack of oligoclonal banding did not suggest demylination. A second CSF analysis on 11/2/94 revealed similar findings; and in addition Anti-purkinje cell and Anti-neuronal antibodies (Yo and Ho) were not found; Beta-2 microglobulin was 1.8 (normal); histoplasmosis Ag negative. Serum ACE, SPEP, Urine histoplasmin were negative.\n\nNeuropsychologic assessment, 10/28/94, raised a question of a demential syndrome, but given her response style on the MMPI (marked defensiveness, with unwillingness to admit to even very common human faults) prevented such a diagnosis. Severe defects in memory, fine motor skills, and constructional praxis were noted.\n\nChest-Abdominal-Pelvic CT scans were negative. 11/4/94 cerebral angiogram noted variable caliber in the RMCA, LACA and Left AICA distributions. It was intially thought that thismight be suggestive of a vasculopathy and she was treated with a short course of IV steroids. Temporal artery biopsy was unremarkable.\n\nShe underwent multiple MRI brain scans at UIHC: 11/4/94, 11/9/94, 11/16/94. All scans consistently showed increase in T2 signal in the brainstem, cerebellar peduncles and temporal lobes bilaterally. These areas did not enhance with gadolinium contrast. These findings were felt most suggestive of glioma.\n\nShe underwent left temporal lobe brain biopsy on 11/10/94: This study was inconclusive and showed evidence of atypical mononuclear cells and lymphocytes in the perivascular and subarachnoid spaces. Despite cytologic atypia the cells were felt to be reactive in nature, since immunohistochemical stains failed to disclose lymphoid clonality or non-leukocytic phenomena. Little sign of vasculopathy or tumor was found. Bacterial, fungal , HSV, CMV and AFB cultures were negative. HSV, and VZV antigen was negative.\n\nHer neurological state progressively worsened throughout her hospital stay. By time of discharge, 12/2/94, she was very somnolent and difficult to arouse and required NGT feeding and 24hour supportive care. She was made DNR after family request prior to transfer to a care facility.

History related to this illness probably dates back to October of 2006 when he had onset of swelling and discomfort in the left testicle with what he described as a residual &quot;lump&quot; posteriorly.  The left testicle has continued to be painful off and on since.  In early November, he developed pain in the posterior part of his upper right leg, which he initially thought was related to skateboarding and muscle strain.  Physical therapy was prescribed and the discomfort temporarily improved.  In December, he noted onset of increasing fatigue.  He used to work out regularly, lifting lifts, doing abdominal exercises, and playing basketball and found he did not have energy to pursue these activities.  He has lost 10 pounds since December and feels his appetite has decreased.  Night sweats and cough began in December, for which he was treated with a course of Augmentin.  However, both of these problems have continued.  He also began taking Accutane for persistent acne in December (this agent was stopped on 02/19/2007).  Despite increasing fatigue and lethargy, he continues his studies at University of Denver, has a biology major (he aspires to be an ophthalmologist).\n\nThe morning of 02/19/2007, he awakened with severe right inguinal and right lower quadrant pain.  He was seen in Emergency Room where it was noted that he had an elevated WBC of 18,000.  CT scan of the abdomen was obtained to rule out possible appendicitis and on that CT, a large clot in the inferior vena cava extending to the right iliac and femoral veins was found.  He promptly underwent appropriate treatment in interventional radiology with the above-noted angioplasty and placement of a vena caval filter followed by mechanical and pharmacologic thrombolysis.  Repeat ultrasound there on 02/20/2007 showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT).  Continuous intravenous unfractionated heparin infusion was continued.  Because there was no obvious cause of this extensive thrombosis, occult malignancy was suspected.  Appropriate blood studies were obtained and he underwent a PET/CT scan as part of his diagnostic evaluation.  This study showed moderately increased diffuse bone marrow metabolic activity.  Because the WBC continued to rise and showed a preponderance of lymphocytes, the smear was reviewed by pathologist, Sheryl Asplund, M.D., and flow cytometry was performed on the peripheral blood.  These studies became available the afternoon of 02/23/2007, and confirmed the diagnosis of precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  The patient was transferred here after stopping of the continuous infusion heparin and receiving a dose of Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneously for further diagnostic evaluation and management of the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).\n\nALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

Parents are in good health.  A maternal great-grandmother had a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of leg in her 40s.  A maternal great-uncle developed leukemia around age 50.  A maternal great-grandfather had bone cancer around age 80.  His paternal grandfather died of colon cancer at age 73, which he had had since age 68.  Adult-onset diabetes is present in distant relatives on both sides.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a student at the University majoring in biology.  He lives in a dorm there.  His parents live in Breckenridge.  He admits to having smoked marijuana off and on with friends and drinking beer off and on as well.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He has had emesis off and on related to Vicodin and constipation since 02/19/2007, also related to pain medication.  He has had acne for about two years, which he describes as mild to moderate.  He denied shortness of breath, chest pain, hemoptysis, dyspnea, headaches, joint pains, rashes, except where he has had dressings applied, and extremity pain except for the right leg pain noted above.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Alert, cooperative, moderately ill-appearing young man.\nVITAL SIGNS:  At the time of admission, pulse was 94, respirations 20, blood pressure 120/62, temperature 98.7, height 171.5 cm, weight 63.04 kg, and pulse oximetry on room air 95%.\nHAIR AND SKIN:  Mild facial acne.\nHEENT:  Extraocular muscles (EOMs) intact.

At the time of admission, the patient has a normal prothrombin time and INR of 13.4 seconds and 1.09 respectively and postoperatively, she was placed on Coumadin which is the usual orthopedic surgery procedure for reducing the risk of postoperative thromboembolic activity.  However, the patient's prothrombin time and INR rapidly rose to supratherapeutic levels.  Even though Coumadin was discontinued on 01/21/09, the patient's prothrombin time and INR has continued to rise.  Her prothrombin time is now 83.3 seconds with an INR of 6.52.  Hematology/Oncology consult was requested for recommendation regarding further evaluation and management.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is originally from Maine.  She has lived in Arizona for 4 years.  She has had 2 children; however, only one is living.  She had one child died from complications of ulcerative colitis.  She has been predominantly a homemaker during her life, but has done some domestic cleaning work in the past.\n\nCHILDHOOD HISTORY:  Negative for rheumatic fever.  The patient has usual childhood illnesses.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's mother died from gastric cancer.  She had a brother who died from mesothelioma.  He did have a positive asbestos exposure working in the shipyards.  The patient's father died from motor vehicle accident.  She had a sister who succumbed to pneumonia as a complication to Alzheimer disease.\n\nHABITS:  No use of ethanol, tobacco, illicit, or recreational substances.\n\nADULT MEDICAL PROBLEMS:  The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, which is all consistent with the metabolic syndrome X.  In addition, the patient's husband, who is present, knows that she has early dementia and has problems with memory and difficulty in processing new information.\n\nSURGERIES:  The patient's only surgery is the aforementioned left knee arthroplasty and bilateral cataract surgery, otherwise negative.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  The patient's medications on admission include:\n1.  Fosamax.\n2.  TriCor.\n3.  Gabapentin.\n4.  Hydrochlorothiazide.\n5.  Labetalol.\n6.  Benicar.\n7.  Crestor.\n8.  Detrol.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Unable to obtain review of systems as the patient was given a dose of morphine for postoperative pain and she is a bit obtunded at this time.  She is arousable, but not particularly conversant.\n\nOBSERVATIONS:\nGENERAL:  The patient is a drowsy, but arousable, nonconversant, elderly Caucasian female.\nHEENT:  Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular muscles are grossly intact.  Oropharynx benign.\nNECK:  Supple.  Full range of motion without bruits or thyromegaly.\nLUNGS:  Clear to auscultation and percussion.\nBACK:  Without spine or CVA tenderness.\nHEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, thrills, or heaves.\nABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.  Positive bowel sounds without mass or visceromegaly.\nLYMPHATIC:  No appreciable adenopathy.\nEXTREMITIES:  The patient has some postoperative fullness involving her left knee.  She has a dressing over the left knee.\nSKIN:  Without lesions.\nNEURO:  Unable to assess in light of post morphine obtunded state.\n\nASSESSMENT:  Hypersensitivity to Coumadin.\n\nPLAN:  Gave the patient vitamin K at this time.  Literature suggested oral vitamin K is actually more efficacious than parenteral.  However, in light of the fact that the patient is obtunded and is not taking anything right now in the way of oral food or fluids, we will give this to her in an IM fashion.  Repeat prothrombin time and INR in a.m.  Once she has come down to a more therapeutic range, I would initiate low-molecular weight heparin in the form of Fragmin one time a day or Lovenox on a b.i.d. schedule for 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively.

After admission, she had a CT of the abdomen done, which showed evidence of diffuse colitis and she was started on IV Flagyl and also on IV Levaquin.  She was also placed on IV Reglan because of nausea and vomiting.  In spite of the above, her white count still continues to be elevated today.  On questioning the patient, she states the nausea and vomiting has resolved, but the diarrhea still present, but otherwise denies any other specific complaints except for some weakness.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent C. diff colitis, which had resolved based on speaking to Dr. X.  Two weeks ago, he had seen the patient and she was clinically well.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Noncontributory.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  No history of smoking, alcohol, or drug use.

UA on 6/18/2009 showed no evidence of UTI.  Sodium today 130, potassium 2.7, and creatinine 0.4.  AST and ALT on 6/20/2009 were normal.  Blood cultures from admission were negative.  Urine culture on admission was negative.  C. diff was positive.  Stool culture was negative.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n1.  A 72-year-old female with Clostridium difficile colitis.\n2.  Diarrhea secondary to above and also could be related Reglan, which was discontinued today.\n3.  Leukocytosis secondary to above, mild improvement today though.\n4.  Bilateral pleural effusion by CT of the chest, although could represent thickening.\n5.  New requirement for oxygen, rule out pneumonia.\n6.  Hypertension.\n\nPLAN:\n1.  Treat the C. diff aggressively especially given CT appearance and her continued leukocytosis and because of the Levaquin, which could have added additional antibiotic pressure, so I will restart the IV Flagyl.\n2.  Continue p.o. vancomycin.  Add Florastor to help replenish the gut flora.\n3.  Monitor WBCs closely and follow clinically and if there is any deterioration in her clinical status, I would recommend getting surgical evaluation immediately for surgery if needed.\n4.  We will check a chest x-ray especially given her new requirement for oxygen.

There is no strip for me to review all available EKG tracings show a narrow complex atrial fibrillation pattern that is now converted to sinus rhythm.\n\nThe patient states that for a week, she has been home postoperative from aortic valve replacement on 12/01/08 at ABC Medical Center.  The aortic stenosis was secondary to a congenital bicuspid valve, by her description.  She states that her shortness of breath with exertion has been stable, but has yet to improve from its preoperative condition.  She has not had any decline in her postoperative period of her tolerance to exertion.\n\nThe patient had noted intermittent bursts of fast heart rate at home that had been increasing over the last several days.  Last night, she had a prolonged episode for which she contacted EMS.  Her medications at home had been uninterrupted and without change from those listed, being Toprol-XL 100 mg q.a.m., Dyazide 25/37.5 mg, Nexium 40 mg, all taken once a day.  She has been maintaining her Crestor and Zetia at 20 and 10 mg respectively.  She states that she has been taking her aspirin at 325 mg q.a.m.  She remains on Zyrtec 10 mg q.a.m.  Her only allergy is listed to latex.\n\nOBJECTIVE:\nVITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 36.1, heart rate 60, respirations 14, room air saturation 98%, and blood pressure 108/60.  The patient shows a normal sinus rhythm on the telemetry monitor with an occasional PAC.\nGENERAL:  She is alert and in no apparent distress.\nHEENT:  Eyes:  EOMI.  PERRLA.  Sclerae nonicteric.  No lesions of lids, lashes, brows, or conjunctivae noted.  Funduscopic examination unremarkable.  Ears:  Normal set, shape, TMs, canals and hearing.  Nose and Sinuses:  Negative.  Mouth, Tongue, Teeth, and Throat:  Negative except for dental work.\nNECK:  Supple and pain free without bruit, JVD, adenopathy or thyroid abnormality.\nCHEST:  Lungs are clear bilaterally to auscultation.  The incision is well healed and without evidence of significant cellulitis.\nHEART:  Shows a regular rate and rhythm without murmur, gallop, heave, click, thrill or rub.  There is an occasional extra beat noted, which corresponds to a premature atrial contraction on the monitor.\nABDOMEN:  Soft and benign without hepatosplenomegaly, rebound, rigidity or guarding.\nEXTREMITIES:  Show no evidence of DVT, acute arthritis, cellulitis or pedal edema.\nNEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal without lateralizing findings for cranial or peripheral nervous systems, strength, sensation, and cerebellar function.  Gait and station were not tested.\nMENTAL STATUS:  Shows the patient to be alert, coherent with full capacity for decision making.\nBACK:  Negative to inspection or percussion.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Shows from 12/15/08 2100, hemoglobin 11.6, white count 12.9, and platelets 126,000.  INR 1.0.  Electrolytes are normal with exception potassium 3.3.  GFR is decreased at 50 with creatinine of 1.1.  Glucose was 119.  Magnesium was 2.3.  Phosphorus 3.8.  Calcium was slightly low at 7.8.  The patient has had ionized calcium checked at Munson that was normal at 4.5 prior to her discharge.  Troponin is negative x2 from 2100 and repeat at 07:32.  This morning, her BNP was 163 at admission.  Her admission chest x-ray was unremarkable and did not show evidence of cardiomegaly to suggest pericardial effusion.  Her current EKG tracing from 05:42 shows a sinus bradycardia with Wolff-Parkinson White Pattern, a rate of 58 beats per minute, and a corrected QT interval of 557 milliseconds.  Her PR interval was 0.12.\n\nWe received a call from Munson Medical Center that a bed had been arranged for the patient.  I contacted Dr. Varner and we reviewed the patient's managed to this point.  All combined impression is that the patient was likely to not have had actual ventricular tachycardia.  This is based on her EP study from October showing her to be non-inducible.  In addition, she had a cardiac catheterization that showed no evidence of coronary artery disease.  What is most likely that the patient has postoperative atrial fibrillation.  Her WPW may have degenerated into a ventricular tachycardia, but this is unlikely.  At this point, we will convert the patient from IV amiodarone to oral amiodarone and obtain an echocardiogram to verify that she does not have evidence of pericardial effusion in the postoperative period.  I will recheck her potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus at this point and make adjustments if indicated.  Dr. Varner will be making arrangements for an outpatient Holter monitor and further followup post-discharge.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.\n2.  Wolff-Parkinson White Syndrome.\n3.  Recent aortic valve replacement with bioprosthetic Medtronic valve.\n4.  Hyperlipidemia.

Both conditions may lead to sleep fragmentation and/or intermittent oxygen desaturation, both of which have significant health implications including poor sleep quality and stress on the cardiovascular system.  Symptoms like daytime somnolence, fatigue, hyperactivity, behavior difficulty (i.e., ADHD) and decreased school performance have been reported with these conditions.  In addition, the most severe cases may be associated with right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary and/or systemic hypertension and even cor pulmonale.\n\nIn this patient, the risks for a sleep-disordered breathing include obesity and the tonsillar hypertrophy.  It is therefore indicated and medically necessary to perform a polysomnogram for further evaluation.  A two week sleep diary will be given to the parents to fill out daily before the polysomnogram is performed.

It was thought that there was a thick mucous plug in the Foley in the ileal conduit that was irrigated by Dr. X.  Her symptoms responded to IV antibiotics and she remained clinically stable.  Klebsiella was isolated in this urine, which was sensitive to Bactrim and she was discharged on p.o.  Bactrim.  She was scheduled on 08/07/2007 for further surgery.  She is to follow up with Dr. Y in 7-10 days.  She also complained of right knee pain and the right knee showed no sign of effusion.  She was exquisitely tender to touch of the patellar tendon.  It was thought that this did not represent intraarticular process.  She was advised to use ibuprofen over-the-counter two to three tabs t.i.d.

She reports that she has chest pain at night.  This happened last year exactly the same.  She went to see Dr. Murphy, and he did a treadmill and an echocardiogram, no concerns for cardiovascular disease, and her symptoms resolved now over the last month.  She wakes in the middle of the night and reports that she has a pressure.  It is mild-to-moderate in the middle of her chest and will stay there as long she lies down.  If she gets up, it goes away within 15 minutes.  It is currently been gone on for the last week.  She denies any fast heartbeats or irregular heartbeats at this time.\n2.  She has been having stomach pains that started about a month ago.  This occurs during the daytime.  It has no relationship to foods.  It is mild in nature, located in the mid epigastric area.  It has been better for one week as well.\n3.  She continues to have reflux, has noticed that if she stops taking Aciphex, then she has symptoms.  If she takes her Aciphex, she seems that she has the reflux belching, burping, and heartburn under control.\n4.  She has right flank pain when she lies down.  She has had this off and on for four months.  It is a dull achy pain.  It is mild in nature.\n5.  She has some spots on her shoulder that have been present for a long time, but over the last month have been getting bigger in size and is elevated whereas they had not been elevated in the past.  It is not painful.\n6.  She has had spots in her armpits initially on the right side and then going to the left side.  They are not itchy.\n7.  She is having problems with urgency of urine.  When she has her bladder full, she suddenly has an urge to use the restroom, and sometimes does not make it before she begins leaking.  She is wearing a pad now.\n8.  She is requesting a colonoscopy for screening as well.  She is wanting routine labs for following her chronic leukopenia, also is desiring a hepatitis titer.\n9.  She has had pain in her thumbs when she is trying to do fine motor skills, has noticed this for the last several months.  There has been no swelling or redness or trauma to these areas.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She has recently been to the eye doctor.  She has noticed some hearing loss gradually.  She denies any problems with swallowing.  She denies episodes of shortness of breath, although she has had a little bit of chronic cough.  She has had normal bowel movements.  Denies any black or bloody stools, diarrhea, or constipation.  Denies seeing blood in her urine and has had no urinary problems other than what is stated above.  She has had no problems with edema or lower extremity numbness or tingling.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She works at nursing home.  She is a nonsmoker.  She is currently trying to lose weight.  She is on the diet and has lost several pounds in the last several months.  She quit smoking in 1972.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Her father has type I diabetes and heart disease.  She has a brother who had heart attack at the age of 52.  He is a smoker.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Episodic leukopenia and mild irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Aciphex 20 mg q.d. and aspirin 81 mg q.d.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known medical allergies.\n\nOBJECTIVE:\nVital Signs:  Weight:  142 pounds.  Blood pressure:  132/78.  Pulse:  72.\nGeneral:  This is a well-developed adult female who is awake, alert, and in no acute distress.\nHEENT:  Her pupils are equally round and reactive to light.  Conjunctivae are white.  TMs look normal bilaterally.  Oropharynx appears to be normal.  Dentition is excellent.\nNeck:  Supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.\nLungs:  Clear with normal respiratory effort.\nHeart:  Regular rhythm and rate without murmur.  Radial pulses are normal bilaterally.\nAbdomen:  Soft, nontender, and nondistended without organomegaly.\nExtremities:  Examination of the hands reveals some tenderness at the base of her thumbs bilaterally as well as at the PIP joint and DIP joint.  Her armpits are examined.  She has what appears to be a tinea versicolor rash present in the armpits bilaterally.  She has a lesion on her left shoulder, which is 6 mm in diameter.  It has diffuse borders and is slightly red.  It has two brown spots in it.  In her lower extremities, there is no cyanosis or edema.  Pulses at the radial and posterior tibial pulses are normal bilaterally.  Her gait is normal.\nPsychiatric:  Her affect is pleasant and positive.\nNeurological:  She is grossly intact.  Her speech seems to be clear.  Her coordination of upper and lower extremities is normal.\n\nASSESSMENT/PLAN:\n1.  Chest pain.  At this point, because of Dr. Murphy s evaluation last year and the symptoms exactly the same, I think this is noncardiac.  My intonation is that this is reflux.  I am going have her double her Aciphex or increase it to b.i.d., and I am going to have her see Dr. XYZ for possible EGD if he thinks that would be appropriate.  She is to let me know if her symptoms are getting worse or if she is having any severe episodes.\n2.  Stomach pain, uncertain at this point, but I feel like this is probably related as well to chest pain.\n3.  Suspicious lesions on the left shoulder.  We will do a punch biopsy and set her up for an appointment for that.\n4.  Tinea versicolor in the axillary area.  I have prescribed selenium sulfide lotion to apply 10 minutes a day for seven days.\n5.  Cystocele.  We will have her see Dr. XYZ for further discussion of repair due to her urinary incontinence.\n6.  History of leukopenia.  We will check a CBC.\n7.

Acute cerebrovascular accident/left basal ganglia and deep white matter of the left parietal lobe.\n2. Hypertension.\n3. Urinary tract infection.\n4. Hypercholesterolemia.\n\nPROCEDURES:\n1. On 3/26/2006, portable chest, single view. Impression: atherosclerotic change in the aortic knob.\n2. On 3/26/2006, chest, portable, single view. Impression: Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta, maybe secondary to hypertension; right lateral costophrenic angle is not evaluated due to positioning of the patient.\n3. On March 27, 2006, swallowing study: Normal swallowing study with minimal penetration with thin liquids.\n4. On March 26, 2006, head CT without contrast: 1) Air-fluid level in the right maxillary sinus suggestive of acute sinusitis; 2) A 1.8-cm oval, low density mass in the dependent portion of the left maxillary sinus is consistent with a retention cyst; 3) Mucoparietal cell thickening in the right maxillary sinus and ethmoid sinuses.\n4. IV contrast CT scan of the head is unremarkable.\n5. On 3/26/2006, MRI/MRA of the neck and brain, with and without contrast: 1) Changes consistent with an infarct involving the right basal ganglia and deep white matter of the left parietal lobe, as described above; 2) Diffuse smooth narrowing of the left middle cerebral artery that may be a congenital abnormality. Clinical correlation is necessary.\n6. On March 27th, echocardiogram with bubble study. Impression: Normal left ventricular systolic function with estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%. There is mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left atrial size is normal with a negative bubble study.\n7. On March 27, 2006, carotid duplex ultrasound showed: 1) Grade 1 carotid stenosis on the right; 2) No evidence of carotid stenosis on the left.\n\nHISTORY AND PHYSICAL: This is a 56-year-old white male with a history of hypertension for 15 years, untreated. The patient woke up at 7: 15 a.m. on March 26 with the sudden onset of right-sided weakness of his arm, hand, leg and foot and also with a right facial droop, right hand numbness on the dorsal side, left face numbness and slurred speech. The patient was brought by EMS to emergency room. The patient was normal before he went to bed the prior night. He was given aspirin in the ER. The CT of the brain without contrast did not show any changes. He could not have a CT with contrast because the machine was broken. He went ahead and had the MRI/MRA of the brain and neck, which showed infarct involving the right basal ganglia and deep white matter of the left parietal lobe. Also, there is diffuse smooth narrowing of the left middle cerebral artery.\n\nThe patient was admitted to the MICU.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE PER PROBLEM LIST:\n1. Acute cerebrovascular accident: The patient was not a candidate for tissue plasminogen activator. A neurology consult was obtained from Dr. S. She agrees with our treatment for this patient. The patient was on aspirin 325 mg and also on Zocor 20 mg once a day. We also ordered fasting blood lipids, which showed cholesterol of 165, triglycerides 180, HDL cholesterol 22, LDL cholesterol 107. Dr. Farber agreed to treat the risk factors, to not treat blood pressure for the first two weeks of the stroke. We put the patient on p.r.n. labetalol only for systolic blood pressure greater than 200, diastolic blood pressure greater than 120. The patient's blood pressure has been stable and he did not need any blood pressure medications. His right leg kept improving with increased muscle strength and it was 4-5/5, however, his right upper extremity did not improve much and was 0-1/5. His slurred speech has been improved a little bit. The patient started PT, OT and speech therapy on the second day of hospitalization. The patient was transferred out to a regular floor on the same day of admission based on his stable neurologic exam. Also, we added Aggrenox for secondary stroke prevention, suggested by Dr. F. Echocardiogram was ordered and showed normal left ventricular function with bubble study that was negative. Carotid ultrasound only showed mild stenosis on the right side. EKG did not show any changes, so the patient will be transferred to Siskin Rehabilitation Hospital today on Aggrenox for secondary stroke prevention. He will not need blood pressure treatment unless systolic is greater than 220, diastolic greater than 120, for the first week of his stroke. On discharge, on his neurologic exam, he has a right facial palsy from the eye below, he has right upper extremity weakness with 0-1/5 muscle strength, right leg is 4-5/5, improved slurred speech.\n2. Hypertension: As I mentioned in item #1, see above, his blood pressure has been stable. This did not need any treatment.\n3. Urinary tract infection: The patient had urinalysis on March 26th, which showed a large amount of leukocyte esterase, small amount of blood with red blood cells 34, white blood cells 41, moderate amount of bacteria. The patient was started on Cipro 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. on March 26th. He needs to finish seven days of antibiotic treatment for his UTI. Urine culture and sensitivity were negative.\n4. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient was put on Zocor 20 mg p.o. daily. The goal LDL for this patient will be less than 70. His LDL currently is 107, HDL is 22, triglycerides 180, cholesterol is 165.\n\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.\n\nACTIVITY: As tolerated.\n\nDIET: Low-fat, low-salt, cardiac diet.\n\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Take medications regularly.\n2. PT, OT, speech therapist to evaluate and treat at Siskin Rehab Hospital.\n3. Continue Cipro for an additional two days for his UTI.\n\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\n1. Cipro 250 mg, one tablet p.o. b.i.d. for an additional two days.\n2. Aggrenox, one tablet p.o. b.i.d.\n3. Docusate sodium 100 mg, one cap p.o. b.i.d.\n4. Zocor 20 mg, one tablet p.o. at bedtime.\n5. Prevacid 30 mg p.o. once a day.\n\nFOLLOW UP:\n1. The patient needs to follow up with Rehabilitation Hospital after he is discharged from there.\n2. The patient can call the Clinic if he needs a follow up appointment with us, or the patient can find a primary care physician since he has insurance.

Approximately one day after the dental procedure, he began having nausea, and abdominal pain along with fatigue. The abdominal pain was described as pressure-like and was located in the epigastrium and periumbilical regions. He initially attributed the symptoms to a side effect of the antibiotic he was taking. However, with worsening of his symptoms, he presented to the ER 5 days after dental extraction.\n\nAt that time his vitals were T 99.9 &deg; HR 115 RR 18 BP 182/101. His exam was notable for mild tenderness in the central abdomen. Laboratory evaluation was notable for WBC 15.6, Hgb 13.1, Plt 189, 16% bands, 68% PMNs. Na 127, K4.7, Cl 88, CO2 29, BUN 19, Cr 1.5, Glucose 155, Ca 9.6, alk phos 125, t bili 0.7, ALT 29, nl amylase and lipase. UA with 100 protein, lg blood, 53 RBC, 2 WBC. Plain films done at that time revealed dilation of small bowel loops in mid-abdomen up to 3.5cm in diameter, thought to be most consistent with a paralytic ileus. The patient was discharged home with diagnosis of medication-induced gastroenteritis vs. UTI. He was instructed to stop his current antibiotic but start Levaquin, and he was given Vicodin, and phenergan for symptomatic relief.\n\nOver the next 2 days, the patient began having fevers, non-bloody emesis, diarrhea, and confusion in addition to his persistent nausea, and abdominal pain. On the night of presentation, the patient was found by a cousin in his bathroom lethargic and disoriented. EMS was called and patient was taken to the ER.

He was doing fairly well until last week while mowing the lawn, he injured his right foot.  He presented to the Hospital Emergency Room.  Cultures taken from the wound on 06/25/2008, were reported positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).  The patient was started on intravenous antibiotic therapy with Levaquin and later on that was changed to oral formulation.  The patient underwent debridement of the wound on 07/29/2008.  Apparently, MRI and a bone scan was performed at that facility, which was reported negative for osteomyelitis.  The patient was then referred to the wound care center at General Hospital.  From there, he has been admitted to Long-Term Acute Care Facility for wound care with wound VAC placement.  On exam, he has a lacerated wound on the plantar aspect of the right foot, which extends from the second metatarsal area to the fifth metatarsal area, closed with the area of the head of these bones.  The wound itself is deep and stage IV and with exam of her gloved finger in my opinion, the third metatarsal bone is palpable, which leads to the clinical diagnosis of osteomyelitis.  The patient has serosanguineous drainage in this wound and it tracks under the skin in all directions except distal.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Positive for:\n1.  Diabetes mellitus.\n2.  Osteomyelitis of the right fifth toe, which was treated with intravenous antibiotic therapy for 6 weeks about 5 years back.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for mother passing away in her late 60s from heart attack, father had liver cancer, and passed away from that.  One of his children suffers from hypothyroidism, 2 grandchildren has cerebral palsy secondary to being prematurely born.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive findings of the foot that have been mentioned above.  All other systems reviewed were negative.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nGeneral:  A 68-year-old Caucasian male who was not in any acute hemodynamic distress at present.\nVital Signs:  Show a maximum recorded temperature of 98, pulse is rating between 67 to 80 per minute, respiratory rate is 20 per minute, blood pressure is varying between 137/63 to 169/75.\nHEENT:  Pupils equal, round, reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Head is normocephalic.  External ear exam is normal.\nNeck:  Supple.  There is no palpable lymphadenopathy.\nCardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm of the heart without any appreciable murmur, rub or gallop.\nLungs:  Clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally.\nAbdomen:  Soft, nontender, and nondistended without any organomegaly and bowel sounds are positive.  There is no palpable lymphadenopathy in the inguinal and femoral area.\nExtremities:  There is no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  There is no peripheral stigmata of endocarditis.  On the plantar aspect of the distal part of the right foot, the patient has a lacerated wound, which extends from the second metatarsal area to the fifth metatarsal area.  Tracking under the skin is palpable with a gloved finger in all direction except the distal one.  On the proximal tracking, the area of the wound, the third metatarsal bone is palpable.  Therefore, clinically, the patient has diagnoses of osteomyelitis.\nCentral nervous system:  The patient is alert, oriented x3.  Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.  There is no focal deficit appreciated.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  No laboratory or radiological data is available at present in the chart.\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN:  A 68-year-old Caucasian male with history of diabetes mellitus who had an accidental lawn mower-associated injury on the right foot.  He has undergone debridement on 07/29/2008.  Culture results from the debridement procedure are not available.  Wound cultures from 07/25/2008 showed methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.\n\nFrom the Infectious Disease point of view, the patient has the following problems, and I would recommend following treatments strategy.\n\n1.  Right foot infected ulcer with clinical evidence of osteomyelitis.  Even if the MRI and bone scan are negative, the treatment should be guided with diagnosis on clinical counts in my opinion.  Cultures have been reported positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.  Therefore, I would discontinue the current antibiotic regimen of oral Levaquin, Zyvox, and intravenous Zosyn, and start the patient on intravenous Ancef 2 g q.8 h.  We will need to continue this treatment for 6 weeks for treatment of osteomyelitis and deep wound infection.  I would also recommend continuation of wound care and wound VAC placement that would start tomorrow.  We will get a PICC line placed to complete the 6-week course of intravenous antibiotic therapy.\n2.  We would check labs including CBC with differential, chemistry 7 panel, LFTs, ESR, and C-reactive protein levels every Monday and chemistry 7 panel and CBC every Thursday for the duration of antibiotic therapy.\n3.  I will continue to monitor wound healing 2 to 3 times a week.  Wound care will be managed by the wound care team at the Long-Term Acute Care Facility.\n4.  The treatment plan was discussed in detail with the patient and his daughter who was visiting him when I saw him.\n5.  Other medical problems will continue to be followed and treated by Dr. X's group during this hospitalization.\n6.  I appreciate the opportunity of participating in this patient's care.  If you have any questions please feel free to call me at any time.  I will continue to follow the patient along with you for the next few days during this hospitalization.  We would also try to get the results of the deep wound cultures from 07/29/2008, MRI, and bone scan from Hospital.

The patient has been followed by Cardiothoracic Surgery (Dr. Z) as an outpatient.  She had a history of daily postprandial vomiting, regurgitation, and heartburn.  She underwent a preop assessment of her GERD and postprandial vomiting including nuclear gastric emptying studies, which showed increased esophageal retention with normal gastric emptying.  Preoperative barium swallow demonstrated moderated esophageal dysmotility with incomplete emptying and a small hiatal hernia.  It was recommended that she undergo an exploratory laparotomy and possible redo fundoplication and possible gastrectomy.  She had already undergone multiple EGDs with dilatations without success.  She continued to have abdominal discomfort.\n\nOn 07/07/2008, she was admitted to hospital.  She underwent an exploratory laparotomy with esophagogastrectomy with esophagogastric anastomosis and Dor fundoplication, repair of hiatal hernia, small bowel resection x2 with primary anastomosis, extensive lysis of adhesions, insertion of a red-rubber J tube, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  She also had her ileojejunal bypass reversed.  Postoperatively, she was able to be extubated.  She was started on TPN, given the risk of not being able to tolerate enteral nutrition.  Her operative note confirmed that the stomach pouch was enlarged with outlet obstruction where the band was.  There was 2 hours of extensive lysis of adhesions.  It took 2 hours to identify the colon.  A defect was repaired in the transverse colon.  The bypass segment of the anastomosis was seen between the proximal jejunum and the distal ileum, which was divided and the proximal jejunum was reconnected to the atretic blind limb of the small bowel.  A red feeding tube was placed proximal to the anastomosis then tended to cross the anastomosis into the distal atretic small bowel for enteral feeds.  The hiatal hernia was repaired as noted.  The obstructed proximal gastric segment was resected.  An anastomosis was made between the proximal intestine and the stomach and distal esophagus with Dor fundoplication.  Omentectomy was performed due to devascularization.  The wound was able to be closed with staples.\n\nPostoperatively, the patient was started on IV antibiotics.  She was able to be extubated.  However, on 07/14/2008, she coded with shortness of breath and chest pain.  She had respiratory failure, required endotracheal intubation and ICU management.  CT scan of the abdomen and the pelvis confirmed that she had an anastomotic leak.  Sputum cultures were positive ESBL Klebsiella.  Blood cultures were negative.  She was managed closely for sepsis with an elevated white cell count.  She was also febrile.  Her chest x-ray also showed left lower lobe consolidation.  She had scattered contrast material in the anterior abdomen and left upper quadrant due to the anastomotic leak.  Her antibiotics were adjusted.  Of note, the patient did have a JP drain placed out to the surface during her initial surgery.  Followup CT scan on 07/16/2008 confirmed the anastomosis as the likely site of a fistula, as there was continued extraluminal enteric contrast seen within anterior abdomen just beneath the peritoneum as well as the left upper quadrant adjacent to the spleen.  No enteric contrast was seen surrounding the patient's known GE junction leak.  A JP drain was noted at the posterior aspect of the fundoplication.  There was only a small amount of pelvic fluid.  Follow up scan again on 07/25/2008 showed no abscess formation.  On 08/05/2008, she did underwent an advancement of the #14 French red-rubber catheter feeding tube distal to the dehiscence of fistula into the distal small bowel.  At the beginning of the procedure, the catheter did appear to traverse through an anastomotic suture line in the wound dehiscence.  At some point during her course, the patient did undergo a second operative procedure, but I do not have any operative note at this time.  She subsequently was left with a large open abdominal defect, which was being managed by the wound care nurses, which at the time of her transfer to this facility was being managed with a &quot;wound manager system.&quot; to low-continuous wall suction.  She was also transferred on tube feedings via the red rubber catheter 20 mL per hour.  She is only to have her tube feeds increased by 10 mL a week to ensure tolerance.  During her course, she was started on TPN.  She was transferred on TPN here.\n\nAt the time of her transfer, the patient was no longer on IV antibiotics.  She is on Fragmin for DVT prophylaxis.  During her course, she did have to undergo a tracheostomy.  This has subsequently been removed and this site is healing.  The tracheostomy was removed on 08/06/2008, I believe.  At the time of her tracheostomy (on 07/22/2008), the patient also underwent a flexible bronchoscopy, which showed some secretions in the left airway (right was clear), which did not appear to be purulent.  Of note also, pathology of her partial stomach resection showed Helicobacter pylori gastritis.  There were no other significant abnormalities noted in the small intestine or omentum.  On 08/11/2008, the patient was transferred to HealthSouth Monroeville LTAC for continued medical management, wound care, and rehab therapies.1\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History of diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - on Lyrica and Cymbalta preoperatively.  History of hypothyroidism, history of B12 deficiency related to prior gastric surgeries, history of osteoarthritis, history of valvular disease (no details available), and cardiac arrhythmias.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Status post bilateral total knee replacements, status post right rotator cuff repair, status post sigmoid colectomy - no further details available, status post right breast lumpectomy for benign lesion, history of bladder repair, status post hysterectomy/tonsillectomy/appendectomy, history of lumbar spinal fusion - no further details available.  History of MRSA in knees (previous surgery).\n\nALLERGIES:  MULTIPLE INCLUDING TETRACYCLINE, ERYTHROMYCIN, MORPHINE, SULFA DRUGS, BETADINE, ADHESIVE TAPES, AND BANDAGE.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Prior to admission, the patient lived alone in a one storied dwelling.  She does have some equipment at home including a powered wheelchair, which she uses for longer distance.  She does have some ambulatory devices also.  She used to smoke, but quit about 10 years ago.  She smoked 1 to 2 packs a day from age 18 to 54.  She does not smoke.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Remarkable for cardiac disease with early death of her father at age 43 and mother had Alzheimer.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  According to her notes, the patient's weight 07/10/2008 was 256 pounds.  She has a BMI of 44 indicating morbid obesity.  She had had a significant weight loss in the 6 months prior to this of 7%.  As noted, she is on TPN and enteral feeds.  Her prealbumin level noted on 07/10/2008 was low at 7.  Prior to admission, the patient ate a regular diet, but had most likely weight loss and inadequate intake due to her chronic postprandial vomiting and esophageal dysmotility.  She is currently NPO with NG to suction.  The patient has no complaints of abdominal pain or discomfort at the time of this exam.  She was awake and alert.  MRSA screen on 07/14/2008 was negative.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nGeneral:  The patient is a morbidly obese woman, who is in no acute distress at the time of this exam.  She is lying comfortably on a low air loss mattress.  She had just been assisted with cleaning up and had no complaints of pain or discomfort.\nVital Signs:  Temperature is 98.9, pulse is 95, blood pressure is 123/69, and weight is 239 pounds.\nHEENT:  Normocephalic/atraumatic.  Extraocular muscles intact.  Her mentation is good.\nNeck:  Stout.  There is good range of motion.\nCor:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs appreciated.\nLungs:  Fairly clear anteriorly.\nAbdomen:  Remarkable for a large open abdominal wound with a collection system in place covering the entire wound in midline.  There is a JP drain and a red rubber catheter present.  At present, the wound manager system is somewhat collapsed.  She had just been on her side.  It is connected to low continuous wall suction and removing fluid.\nMusculoskeletal:  There is PICC line present in the right upper extremity.  No significant pedal edema.  Bilateral knee scars from prior surgeries.\nSkin:  Reported intact at this time (not seen by me).\nNeurological:  Cranial nerves II through XII grossly intact.  She is able to answer questions appropriately.  She is able to raise both arms over head.  She is able to raise her legs, but does need assistance.  She has fair bed mobility and requires much assistance for any turning.  Gait and transfers not tested.\n\nSUMMARY:  In summary, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with a remote history of ileojejunal bypass followed by gastric banding to facilitate weight loss.  However, she subsequently developed reflux associated with postprandial vomiting, which was found to be secondary to esophageal retention.  On 07/08/2008, she underwent exploratory laparotomy with esophagogastrectomy with esophagogastric anastomosis and Dor fundoplication, hiatal hernia repair, small bowel resection, and lysis of adhesions.  She has had a fairly rocky postoperative course and has subsequently underwent some type of re-exploration after she was noted to have enteric contents draining from her JP drain with confirmed anastomotic leak.  She has undergone placement on an NG tube.  At present, she is on enteral feeds as well as TPN.  During all these, she also coded and had respiratory failure, requiring vent management, but this has improved.  Her trach has been removed and this site is healing.  From the wound standpoint, her largest problem at this point is the abdominal wound, which is open.  A wound manager system is currently in place, which is connected to low intermittent wall suction for drainage of the enteral contents still present. At present, the drainage is quite yellow in appearance.  She has no significant complaints of pain at this time.  At some point in her notes, there was mention of a negative pressure wound therapy being used to this wound, but this cannot be confirmed at this time.  I will plan to contact Dr. Z's office to see whether or not they wanted to resume a wound VAC system to this wound.  For now, we will continue with wound manager system.  We will need to keep track of in's and out's of drainage from this site.  Her fluid status will need to be monitored.  In an attempt to get her mobilized, we will need extra care to be sure that this wound dressing/management system stays in place.  She is eager and motivated to get mobilized.  We will plan to ask Plastic (Dr. A) to be involved in following this wound also.  Again, I will plan to call the surgeon's office for further directions.  She is to follow up with Dr. Z in 2 weeks.\n\nLater in afternoon, I was able to reach Dr. Z's office.  I was called back by one of his nurses, who advised me that a wound VAC (negative pressure wound therapy) was not to be used on this wound.  They are using the wound manager system.  She did report that the confusion came about with the inability during her discharge summary dictation that she was only able to cite a &quot;wound VAC&quot; when describing the system that was in place on the patient.  She was using a formatted discharge summary program.  At present, the patient has had some leakage from the system.  According to my discussion with our wound care coordinator at this time, this system has been removed, with leakage repaired, and replaced with another wound manager system with suctioning continuing.  Pictures were also taken of the wound bed.  There were several staples apparently in place.  I was not present at the time that this system had to be changed.

She states that she was injured on December 4, 2001, &quot;I was using my right arm to paint with under the bonnet and trunk inside the __________ putting props with her right arm for the trunk and the bonnet, and taking the props out of the trunk and bonnet and painting with the right arm.  She denies having symptoms or any injury with right shoulder prior to December 4, 2000.  It is noted that there is a lapse and care from August 2002 until October 2006.  She received treatment from Dr. X that consisted of massage therapy, Darvocet, and Ultracet.  She also saw Dr. Y who recommended a Mumford procedure, decompression and rotator cuff tear.  He felt that she did not have an impingement syndrome.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:  August 6, 2002, MRI right shoulder showed a partial rotator cuff tear of the supraspinatus.  June 25, 2007, MRI of the right shoulder showed minimal degenerative change of the acromioclavicular joint.  A partial bursal side tear of the supraspinatus with tendinopathy of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus and subscapularis.\n\nAccording to the patient surgery was performed on August 6, 2007, by Dr. Z, which according to the patient was a repair of a torn rotator cuff and a Mumford.  There is no operative report available in the records.\n\nRECORDS REVIEWED:\n1.  March 7, 2001, FROI.\n2.  April 9, 2007, Dr. Y, IME\n3.  July 10, 2007, Dr. Z, M.D., office notes in which he stated there was no impingement syndrome.\n4.  May 17, 2007, Dr. X, office notes who first saw her on May 17, 2007.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Due to her recent surgery on August 6, 2007, only a limited physical examination could be performed.  There was a healing 1-1/2 inch saber cut incision over the anterior aspect of the right shoulder, which was tender.  She also had tenderness in the clavicle as well as the AC joint and the head of the humerus.  Reflexes were intact.  There was no sensory loss.  No evidence for causalgia, peripheral vascular disease, or an arthroplasty.  Range of motion was not performed due to the recent surgery and her motor power; however, shoulder was not tested due to the recent rotator cuff repair.\n\nQUESTION:  Ms. XXXXX has filed an application for the additional allowance of aggravation of the right AC joint arthrosis.  Based on the current objective findings, mechanism of injury, medical records, or diagnostic studies, does the medical evidence support the existence of the requested condition?\n\nANSWER:  Yes.  Her MRI of June 25, 2007, did state that there was minimal degenerative change in the AC joint.  Therefore, the condition does exist.\n\nQUESTION:  If you find this condition exists is it a direct and proximate result of the December 4, 2000, injury?\n\nANSWER:  No.  This is a degenerative condition, nontraumatic, and certainly the mechanism of injury, which I described under history, would not have injured the acromioclavicular joint.  There also is no objective evidence that this was aggravated by the injury, as there are no objective records after her injury of December 4, 2000, which would document that.\n\nQUESTION:  Do you find that Ms. XXXXX's injury or disability is caused by natural deterioration of tissue, an organ, or part of the body.\n\nANSWER:  Yes.  Osteoarthritis of the acromioclavicular joint or degenerative changes of the acromioclavicular joint or as the word states a degenerative condition nontraumatic that is on the basis of a natural deterioration of tissue and not on the basis of the injury and specifically not the injury of December 4, 2000.\n\nQUESTION:  In addition, if you find that there condition exists, are there non occupational activities or intervening injuries that could have contributed to Ms. XXXXX's condition?\n\nANSWER:  She denies having any injury to her shoulder other than the repetitive motion of her job and there are no other occupational activities that would have contributed to this.

The patient stated she was in her normal state of well being when she was experiencing having frequent seizures.  She lives in assisted living.  She has been falling more frequently.  The patient was driving a scooter and apparently was hitting into the wall with unresponsiveness in association with this.  There was no head trauma, but apparently she was doing that many times and there was no responsiveness.  The patient has no memory of the event.  She is now back to her baseline.  She states her seizures are worse in the setting of stress, but it is not clear to her why this has occurred.  She is on Carbatrol 300 mg b.i.d. and she has been very compliant and without any problems.  The patient is admitted for EMU monitoring for the characterization of these episodes and for the possibility of complex partial epilepsy syndrome or better characterization of this current syndrome.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Include dyslipidemia and hypertension.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for stroke and sleep apnea.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  No smoking or drinking.

The patient reports that she was hospitalized over the weekend for DKA.  She indicates that her blood sugar on Friday night was 187 at bedtime and that when she woke up in the morning her blood sugar was 477.  She gave herself, in smaller increments, a total of 70 extra units of her Humalog.  Ten of those units were injectable; the others were in the forms of pump.  Her blood sugar was over 600 when she went to the hospital later that day.  She is here at this consultation complaining of not feeling well still because she has a cold.  She realizes that this is likely because her immune system was so minimized in the hospital.\n\nOBJECTIVE:  Current insulin doses on her insulin pump are boluses set at 5 units at breakfast, 6 units at lunch and 11 units at supper.  Her basal rates have not been changed since her last visit with Charla Yassine and totaled 30.5 units per 24 hours.  A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on carbohydrate counting at 1 unit of insulin for every 10 g carbohydrate ratio was recommended.  A correction dose of approximately 1 unit of insulin to bring the blood sugars down 30 mg/dl was also recommended.  The Lilly guide for meal planning was provided and reviewed.  Additional carbohydrate counting book was provided.\n\nASSESSMENT:  The patient was taught an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio of 1 unit to 10 g of carbohydrates as recommended at the previous visit two years ago, which she does not recall.  It is based on the 500 rule which suggests this ratio.  We did identify carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing 15-g equivalents.  We also identified the need to dose her insulin at the time that she is eating her carbohydrate sources.  She does seem to have a pattern of fixing blood sugars later in the day after they are elevated.  We discussed the other option of trying to eat a consistent amount of carbohydrates at meals from day to day and taking a consistent amount of insulin at those meals.  With this in mind, she was recommended to follow with three servings or 45 g of carbohydrate at breakfast, three servings or 45 g of carbohydrate at lunch and four servings or 60 g of carbohydrate at dinner.  Joanne Araiza joined our consultation briefly to discuss whether her pump was working appropriately.  The patient was given an 800 number for the pump to contact should there be any question about its failure to deliver insulin appropriately.\n\nPLAN:  Recommend the patient use 1 unit of insulin for every 10-g carbohydrate load consumed.  Recommend the patient either use this as a carbohydrate counting tool or work harder at keeping carbohydrate content consistent at meals from day to day.  This was a one-hour consultation.  Provided my name and number should additional needs arise.

He was cyanotic and pulseless according to witnesses. EMT evaluation revealed him to be in ventricular fibrillation and he was given epinephrine, lidocaine, bretylium and electrically defibrillated and intubated in the field. Upon arrival at a local ER his cardiac rhythm deteriorated and he required more than 9 counter shocks (defibrillation) at 360 joules per shock, epinephrine and lidocaine. This had no effect. He was then given intracardiac epinephrine and a subsequent electrical defibrillation placed him in atrial fibrillation. He was then taken emergently to cardiac catherization and was found to have normal coronary arteries. He was then admitted to an intensive care unit and required intraortic balloon pump pressure support via the right gorin. His blood pressure gradually improved and his balloon pump was discontinued on 5/5/95. Recovery was complicated by acute renal failure and liver failure. Initail CK=13,780, the CKMB fraction was normal at 0.8.\n\nOn 3/10/95, the patient experienced CP and underwent cardiac catherization. This time he was found to have a single occlusion in the distal LAD with association inferior hypokinesis. Subsequent CK=1381 and CKMB=5.4 (elevated). The patient was amnestic to the event and for 10 days following the event. He was transferred to UIHC for cardiac electrophysiology study.\n\nMEDS: Nifedipine, ASA, Amiodarone, Capoten, Isordil, Tylenol, Darvocet prn, Reglan prn, Coumadin, KCL, SLNTG prn, CaCO3, Valium prn, Nubain prn.\n\nPMH: hypercholesterolemia.\n\nFHX: Father alive age 69 with h/o TIAs.

Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally.\n\nCOURSE: MRI Pelvis, 3/28/95, revealed increased T1 weighted signal within the right iliopsoas suggestive of hematoma. An intra-osseous lipoma was incidentally notice in the right sacrum. Neuropsychologic assessment showed moderately compromised anterograde verbal memory, and temporal orientation and retrograde recall were below expectations. These findings were consistent with mesial temporal dysfunction secondary to anoxic injury and were mild in lieu of his history. He underwent implantation of a Medtronic internal cardiac difibrillator. His cardiac electrophysiology study found no inducible ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. He suffered mild to moderate permanent RLE weakness, especially involving the quadriceps. His femoral nerve compression had been present to long to warrant decompression. EMG/NCV studies revealed severe axonal degeneration.

Transthoracic echocardiogram showed mild mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation and a left to right shunt. There was no evidence of blood clot.\n\nHospital course: 5 days after admission the patient began to complain of proximal LLE and left flank pain. On exam, she had weakness of the quadriceps and hip flexors of the LLE. Her pain increased with left hip flexion. In addition, she complained of paresthesias about the lateral aspect of the medial anterior left thigh; and upon on sensory testing, she had decreased PP/TEMP sensation in a left femoral nerve distribution. She denied any back/neck pain and the rest of her neurologic exam remained unchanged from admission.\n\nAbdominal CT Scan, 2/4/96, revealed a large left retroperitoneal iliopsoas hematoma.\n\nHgb 8.9g/dl. She was transfused with 4 units of pRBCs. She underwent surgical decompression and evacuation of the hematoma via a posterior flank approach on 2/6/96. Her postoperative course was uncomplicated. She was discharged home on ASA.\n\nAt follow-up, on 2/23/96, she complained of left sided paresthesias (worse in the LLE than in the LUE) and feeling of &quot;swollen left foot.&quot; These symptoms had developed approximately 1 month after her stroke. Her foot looked normal and her UE strength was 5/4+ proximally and distally, and LE strength 5/4+ proximally and 5/5- distally. She was ambulatory. There was no evidence of LUE upward drift. A somatosensory evoked potential study revealed an absent N20 and normal P14 potentials. This was suggestive of a lesion involving the right thalamus which might explain her paresthesia/dysesthesia as part of a Dejerine-Roussy syndrome.

The issues involved include the fact that for the last 10 years he has been on disability for psychiatric reasons and has been not working, and in the last several weeks to month he began to call his family talking about the fact that he had been sexually abused by brother.  He has been in outpatient therapy with Jeffrey Silverberg for the past 10 years and Mr. Silverberg became concerned about his behavior, called the family and told them to have him put in the hospital, and at one point called the police because the patient was throwing cellphones and having tantrums in his office.\n\nThe history includes the fact that the patient is the 3rd of 4 children.  A brother who is approximately 8 years older, sexually abused brother who is 4 years older.  The brother who is 8 years older lives in California and will contact the family, has had minimal contact for many years.\n\nThat brother in California is gay.  The brother who is 4 years older, sexually abused, the patient from age 8 to 12 on a regular basis.  He said, he told his mother several years ago, but she did nothing about it.\n\nThe patient finished high school and with some struggle completed college at the University of Houston.  He has a sister who is approximately a year and half younger than he is, who was sexually abused by the brothers will, but only on one occasion.  She has been concerned about patient's behavior and was instrumental in having him committed.\n\nReportedly, the patient ran away from home at the age of 12 or 13 because of the abuse, but was not able to tell his family what happened.\n\nHe had no or minimal psychiatric treatment growing up and after completing college worked in retail part time.\n\nHe states he injured his back about 10 yeas ago.  He told he had disk problems but never had surgery.  He subsequently was put on psychiatric disability for depression, states he has been unable to get out of bed at times and isolates and keeps to himself.\n\nHe has been on a variety of different medications including Celexa 40 mg and ADD medication different times, and reportedly has used amphetamines in the past, although he denies it at this time.  He minimizes any alcohol use which appears not to be a problem, but what does appear to be a problem is he isolates, stays at home, has been in situations where he brings in people he does not know well and he runs the risk of getting himself physically harmed.\n\nHe has never been psychiatrically hospitalized before.\n\nMENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION:  Revealed a somewhat disheveled 40-year-old man who was clearly quite depressed and somewhat shocked at his family's commitment.  He says he has not seen them on a regular basis because every time he sees them he feels hurt and acknowledged that he called up the brother who abused him and told the brother's wife what had happened.  The brother has a child and wife became very upset with him.\n\nNormocephalic.  Pleasant, cooperative, disheveled man with about 37 to 40, thoughts were somewhat guarded.  His affect was anxious and depressed and he denied being suicidal, although the family said that he has talked about it at times.\n\nRecent past memory were intact.\n\nDIAGNOSES:\nAxis I:  Major depression rule out substance abuse.\nAxis II:  Deferred at this time.\nAxis III:  Noncontributory.\nAxis IV:  Family financial and social pressures.\nAxis V:  Global Assessment of Functioning 40.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:  The patient will be hospitalized to assess.\n\nAlong the issues, the fact that he is been living in disability in the fact that his family has had to support him for all this time despite the fact that he has had a college degree.  He says he has had several part time jobs, but never been able to sustain employment, although he would like to.

Tinea pedis.  Wart on the finger.  Hyperlipidemia.  Tobacco abuse.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nSUBJECTIVE:  This patient presents to the office today for a checkup.  He has several things to go over and discuss.  First he is sick.  He has been sick for a month intermittently, but over the last couple of weeks it is worse.  He is having a lot of yellow phlegm when he coughs.  It feels likes it is in his chest.  He has been taking Allegra-D intermittently, but he is almost out and he needs a refill.  The second problem, his foot continues to breakout.  It seems like it was getting a lot better and now it is bad again.  He was diagnosed with tinea pedis previously, but he is about out of the Nizoral cream.  I see that he is starting to breakout again now that the weather is warmer and I think that is probably not a coincidence.  He works in the flint and it is really hot where he works and it has been quite humid lately.  The third problem is that he has a wart or a spot that he thinks is a wart on the right middle finger.  He is interested in getting that frozen today.  Apparently, he tells me I froze a previous wart on him in the past and it went away.  Next, he is interested in getting some blood admin done.  He specifically mentions the blood admin for his prostate, which I informed him is called the PSA.  He is 50 years old now.  He will also be getting his cholesterol checked again because he has a history of high cholesterol.  He made a big difference in his cholesterol by quitting smoking, but unfortunately after taking his social history today he tells me that he is back to smoking.  He says it is difficult to quit.  He tells me he did quit chewing tobacco.  I told him to keep trying to quit smoking.  \n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  General:  With this illness he has had no problems with fever.  HEENT:  Some runny nose, more runny nose than congestion.  Respiratory:  Denies shortness of breath.  Skin:  He has a peeling skin on the bottom of his feet, mostly the right foot that he is talking about today.  At times it is itchy.\n\nOBJECTIVE:  His weight is 238.4 pounds, blood pressure 128/74, temperature 97.8, pulse 80, and respirations 16.  General exam:  The patient is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  Ears:  Tympanic membranes pearly gray bilaterally.  Mouth:  No erythema, ulcers, vesicles, or exudate noted.  Neck is supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.  No rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.  Extremities:  No edema, cyanosis, or clubbing.  Skin exam:  I checked out the bottom of his right foot.  He has peeling skin visible consistent with tinea pedis.  On the anterior aspect of the right third finger there is a small little raised up area that I believe represents a wart.  The size of this wart is approximately 3 mm in diameter.\n\nASSESSMENT:  \n1.  Upper respiratory tract infection, persistent.\n2.  Tinea pedis.\n3.  Wart on the finger.\n4.  Hyperlipidemia.\n5.  Tobacco abuse.\n\nPLAN:  The patient is getting a refill on Allegra-D.  I am giving him a refill on the Nizoral 2% cream that he should use to the foot area twice a day.  I gave him instructions on how to keep the foot clean and dry because I think the reason we are dealing with this persistent problem is the fact that his feet are hot and sweaty a lot because of his work.  His wart has been present for some time now and he would like to get it frozen.  I offered him the liquid nitrogen treatment and he did agree to it.  I used liquid nitrogen after a verbal consent was obtained from the patient to freeze the wart.  He tolerated the procedure very well.  I froze it once and I allowed for a 3 mm freeze zone.  I gave him verbal wound care instructions after the procedure.  Lastly, when he is fasting I am going to send him to the lab with a slip, which I gave him today for a basic metabolic profile, CBC, fasting lipid profile, and a screening PSA admin.  Lastly, for the upper respiratory tract infection, I am giving him amoxicillin 500 mg three times a day for 10 days.

No history of diabetes, stroke or coronary artery disease.\n\nSURGICAL HISTORY:  Include left total hip replacement many years ago, history of hysterectomy, and appendectomy in the young age.\n\nALLERGIES:  DENIED.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  According to the list shows the patient takes hydrocodone 10/325 mg every 6 hours, Flexeril 10 mg p.o. at bedtime, and Xanax 0.25 mg p.o. 4 times a day.  The patient also takes Neurontin 200 mg 3 times a day, propranolol 10 mg twice a day, oxybutynin 5 mg p.o. twice a day, Namenda 10 mg p.o. daily, and Aricept 10 mg p.o. daily.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her husband, usually walks with a walker and wheelchair-bound, does not walk much as per the husband knows.  No history of alcohol abuse or smoking.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nGENERAL:  Currently lying in the bed without apparent distress, very lethargic.\nVITAL SIGNS:  Pulse rate of 55, blood pressure is 92/52, after IV fluid came up to 105/58.\nCHEST:  Shows bilateral air entry present, clear to auscultate.\nHEART:  S1 and S2 regular.\nABDOMEN:  Soft, nondistended, and nontender.\nEXTREMITIES:  Shows the patient's straight leg raising to be only up to 30% causing the patient severe back pain.\n\nIMAGING:  The patient's x-ray of the lumbosacral spine done shows there is a L1 compression fracture with some osteophyte formation in the lumbar spine suggestive of degenerative joint disease.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  The patient's lab admin is not done currently, but previous lab admin done in 3/2009 seems to be in acceptable range.\n\nIMPRESSION:  The patient, because of near syncopal episode and polypharmacy, almost passed out for about 3 to 4 minutes in front of me with a low blood pressure.\n1.  Vasovagal syncope versus polypharmacy because of 3 to 4 medications and muscle relaxants.\n2.  Osteoporosis of the spine with L1 compression fracture causing the patient severe pain.\n3.  Hypertension, now hypotension.\n4.  Incontinence of the bladder.\n5.  Dementia, most likely Alzheimer type.\n\nPLAN AND SUGGESTION:  Initial plan was to send the patient to the nursing home, but because of the patient's low blood pressure and heart rate low, we will admit the patient to DOU for 23-hour observation, start the patient on IV fluid, normal saline, 20 mEq KCl, and Protonix 40 mg, and we will also continue the patient's Namenda and Aricept.  I will hold the patient's hydrocodone.  I will hold the Flexeril and I will also hold gabapentin at this moment.  We will give the patient's pain control with Percocet and very minimal morphine sulfate as needed.  Also give the patient calcium with vitamin D and physical therapy.  We will also order a blood admin and further management will be based on the patient's all admin results.  I also explained to the husband that tomorrow if the patient is better and more alert and awake, then we will send her to the nursing care versus home, it depends on the pain control.

He states that this began approximately one week ago when he was lifting stacks of cardboard.  The motion that he describes is essentially picking up a stack of cardboard at his waist level, twisting to the right and delivering it at approximately waist level.  Sometimes he has to throw the stacks a little bit as well.  He states he felt a popping sensation on 06/30/04.  Since that time, he has had persistent shoulder pain with lifting activities.  He localizes the pain to the posterior and to a lesser extent the lateral aspect of the shoulder.  He has no upper extremity .  \n \nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Focal lateral and posterior shoulder pain without a suggestion of any cervical radiculopathies.  He denies any chronic cardiac, pulmonary, GI, GU, neurologic, musculoskeletal, endocrine abnormalities.  \n \nMEDICATIONS:  Claritin for allergic rhinitis.  \n \nALLERGIES:  None.  \n \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure 120/90, respirations 10, pulse 72, temperature 97.2.  He is sitting upright, alert and oriented, and in no acute distress.  Skin is warm and dry. Gross neurologic examination is normal.  ENT examination reveals normal oropharynx, nasopharynx, and tympanic membranes.  Neck: Full range of motion with no adenopathy or thyromegaly.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs:  Clear.  Abdomen: Soft.   \n \nOn examination of the shoulder, he is mild to moderately tender in the posterolateral aspect of the subacromial space.  His range of motion is abduction to 90 degrees, before experiencing pain.  He can push this to 120 degrees.  He also has flexion of 120 degrees but it reluctant to move it past this.  He has a very mild response to both Neer's and Hawkins impingement testing. He has negative sulcus, apprehension, Speed's and Yergason's testing.  \n \nDIAGNOSTIC IMAGING: Two view x-rays were taken of the shoulder.  There are no osseous abnormalities or significant degenerative changes.  \n \nIMPRESSION:  Right shoulder pain, most likely secondary to muscular strain.  He does have a very mild evidence of impingement.  \n \nPLAN: The patient is cleared for work.  He has the next three days off due to a plant shutdown.  Should he have any persistent pain next week, I would considering obtaining an MRI.

Congestive heart failure, stable on current regimen.  Diabetes type II, A1c improved with increased doses of NPH insulin.  Hyperlipidemia, chronic renal insufficiency, and arthritis.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nREASON FOR VISIT:  Followup evaluation and management of chronic medical conditions.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient has been doing quite well since he was last seen.  He comes in today with his daughter.  He has had no symptoms of CAD or CHF.  He had followup with Dr. X and she thought he was doing quite well as well.  He has had no symptoms of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.  He has had no falls.  His right knee does pain him at times and he is using occasional doses of Tylenol for that.  He wonders whether he could use a knee brace to help him with that issue as well.  His spirits are good.  He has had no incontinence.  His memory is clear, as is his thinking.\n\nMEDICATIONS:\n1.  Bumex - 2 mg daily.\n2.  Aspirin - 81 mg daily.\n3.  Lisinopril - 40 mg daily.\n4.  NPH insulin - 65 units in the morning and 25 units in the evening.\n5.  Zocor - 80 mg daily.\n6.  Toprol-XL - 200 mg daily.\n7.  Protonix - 40 mg daily.\n8.  Chondroitin/glucosamine - no longer using.\n\nMAJOR FINDINGS:  Weight 240, blood pressure by nurse 160/80, by me 140/78, pulse 91 and regular, and O2 saturation 94%.  He is afebrile.  JVP is normal without HJR.  CTAP.  RRR.  S1 and S2.  Aortic murmur unchanged.  Abdomen:  Soft, NT without HSM, normal BS.  Extremities:  No edema on today's examination.  Awake, alert, attentive, able to get up on to the examination table under his own power.  Able to get up out of a chair with normal get up and go.  Bilateral OA changes of the knee.\n\nCreatinine 1.7, which was down from 2.3.  A1c 7.6 down from 8.5.  Total cholesterol 192, HDL 37, and triglycerides 487.\n\nASSESSMENTS:\n1.  Congestive heart failure, stable on current regimen.  Continue.\n2.  Diabetes type II, A1c improved with increased doses of NPH insulin.  Doing self-blood glucose monitoring with values in the morning between 100 and 130.  Continue current regimen.  Recheck A1c on return.\n3.  Hyperlipidemia, at last visit, he had 3+ protein in his urine.  TSH was normal.  We will get a 24-hour urine to rule out nephrosis as the cause of his hypertriglyceridemia.  In the interim, both Dr. X and I have been considering together as to whether the patient should have an agent added to treat his hypertriglyceridemia.  Specifically we were considering TriCor (fenofibrate).  Given his problems with high CPK values in the past for now, we have decided not to engage in that strategy.  We will leave open for the future.  Check fasting lipid panel today.\n4.  Chronic renal insufficiency, improved with reduction in dose of Bumex over time.\n5.  Arthritis, stable.  I told the patient he could use Extra Strength Tylenol up to 4 grams a day, but I suggest that he start with a regular dose of 1 to 2 to 3 grams per day.  He states he will inch that up slowly.  With regard to a brace, he stated he used one in the past and that did not help very much.  I worry a little bit about the tourniquet type effect of a brace that could increase his edema or put him at risk for venous thromboembolic disease.  For now he will continue with his cane and walker.\n6.  Health maintenance, flu vaccination today.\n\nPLANS:  Followup in 3 months, by phone sooner as needed.

Seizure.\n2.  Hypoglycemia.\n3.  Anemia.\n4.  Hypotension.\n5.  Dyspnea.\n6.  Edema.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\n1.  Colon cancer, status post right hemicolectomy.\n2.  Anemia.\n3.  Hospital-acquired pneumonia.\n4.  Hypertension.\n5.  Congestive heart failure.\n6.  Seizure disorder.\n\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED:\n1.  Colonoscopy.\n2.  Right hemicolectomy.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 59-year-old female with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus requiring insulin for 26 years, previous MI and coronary artery disease, history of seizure disorder, GERD, bipolar disorder, and anemia.  She was admitted due to a seizure and myoclonic jerks as well as hypoglycemia and anemia.  Regarding the seizure disorder, Neurology was consulted.  Noncontrast CT of the head was negative.  Neurology felt that the only necessary intervention at that time would be to increase her Lamictal to 150 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening with gradual increase of the dosage until she was on 200 mg b.i.d.  Regarding the hypoglycemia, the patient has diabetic gastroparesis and was being fed on J-tube intermittent feedings throughout the night at the rate of 120 an hour.  Her insulin pump had a basal rate of roughly three at night during the feedings.  While in the hospital, the insulin pump rate was turned down to 1.5 and then subsequently decreased a few other times.  She seemed to tolerate the insulin pump rate well throughout her hospital course.  There were a few episodes of hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, but the episode seem to be related to the patient's n.p.o. status and the changing rates of tube feedings throughout her hospital course.\n\nAt discharge, her endocrinologist was contacted.  It was decided to change her insulin pump rate to 3 units per hour from midnight till 6 a.m., from 0.8 units per hour from 6 a.m. until 8 a.m., and then at 0.2 units per hour from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m.  The insulin was to be NovoLog.  Regarding the anemia, the gastroenterologists were consulted regarding her positive Hemoccult stools.  A colonoscopy was performed, which found a mass at the right hepatic flexure.  General Surgery was then consulted and a right hemicolectomy was performed on the patient.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and tube feeds were slowly restarted following the procedure, and prior to discharge were back at her predischarge rates of 120 per hour.  Regarding the cancer itself, it was found that 1 out of 53 nodes were positive for cancer.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no metastasis, a CT of the chest revealed possible lung metastasis.  Later in hospital course, the patient developed a septic-like picture likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia.  She was treated with Zosyn, Levaquin, and vancomycin, and tolerated the medications well.  Her symptoms decreased and serial chest x-rays were followed, which showed some resolution of the illness.  The patient was seen by the Infectious Disease specialist.  The Infectious Disease specialist recommended vancomycin to cover MRSA bacteria, which was found at the J-tube site.  At discharge, the patient was given three additional days of p.o. Levaquin 750 mg as well as three additional days of Bactrim DS every 12 hours.  The Bactrim was used to cover the MRSA at the J-tube site.  It was found that MRSA was sensitive to Bactrim.  Throughout her hospital course, the patient continued to receive Coreg 12.5 mg daily and Lasix 40 mg twice a day for her congestive heart failure, which remains stable.  She also received Lipitor for her high cholesterol.  Her seizure disorder remained stable and she was discharged on a dose of 100 mg in the morning and 150 mg at night.  The dosage increases can begin on an outpatient basis.\n\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/MEDICATIONS:  The patient was discharged to home.  She was told to shy away from strenuous activity.  Her discharge diet was to be her usual diet of isotonic fiber feeding through the J-tube at a rate of 120 per hour throughout the night.  The discharge medications were as follows:\n1.  Coreg 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.\n2.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. at bedtime.\n3.  Nitro-Dur patch 0.3 mg per hour one patch daily.\n4.  Phenergan syrup 6.25 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n.\n5.  Synthroid 0.175 mg p.o. daily.\n6.  Zyrtec 10 mg p.o. daily.\n7.  Lamictal 100 mg p.o. daily.\n8.  Lamictal 150 mg p.o. at bedtime.\n9.  Ferrous sulfate drops 325 mg, PEG tube b.i.d.\n10.  Nexium 40 mg p.o. at breakfast.\n11.  Neurontin 400 mg p.o. t.i.d.\n12.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.\n13.  Fentanyl 50 mcg patch transdermal q.72h.\n14.  Calcium and vitamin D combination, calcium carbonate 500 mg/vitamin D 200 units one tab p.o. t.i.d.\n15.  Bactrim DS 800mg/160 mg tablet one tablet q.12h. x3 days.\n16.  Levaquin 750 mg one tablet p.o. x3 days.\n\nThe medications listed above, one listed as p.o. are to be administered via the J-tube.\n\nFOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed to see Dr. X in approximately five to seven days.  She was given a lab sheet to have a CBC with diff as well as a CMP to be drawn prior to her appointment with Dr. X.  She is instructed to follow up with Dr. Y if her condition changes regarding her colon cancer.  She was instructed to follow up with Dr. Z, her oncologist, regarding the positive lymph nodes.  We were unable to contact Dr. Z, but his telephone number was given to the patient and she was instructed to make a followup appointment.  She was also instructed to follow up with her endocrinologist, Dr. A, regarding any insulin pump adjustments, which were necessary and she was also instructed to follow up with Dr. B, her gastroenterologist, regarding any issues with her J-tube.\n\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

Options such as watchful waiting, laser lithotripsy, and shockwave lithotripsy were discussed.  The patient has a pretty enlarged stone.  Failure of the procedure if the stone is significantly impacted into the ureteral wall was discussed.  The patient understood that the success of the surgery may be or may not be 100%, that she may require shockwave lithotripsy if we are unable to get the entire stone out in one sitting.  The patient understood all the risk, benefits of the procedure and wanted to proceed.  Need for stent was also discussed with the patient.  The patient will be scheduled for surgery tomorrow.  Plan for continuation of the antibiotics, obtain urinalysis and culture, and plan for KUB to evaluate for the exact location of the stone prior to surgery tomorrow.

He has history of neurogenic bladder, and on intermittent self-catheterization 3 times a day.  However, June 24, 2008, he was seen in the ER, and with fever, weakness, possible urosepsis.  He had a blood culture, which was positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis, as well as urine culture noted for same bacteria.  He was treated on IV antibiotics, Dr. XYZ also saw the patient.  Discharged home.  Not taking any antibiotics.  Today in the office, the patient denies any dysuria, gross hematuria, fever, chills.  He is catheterizing 3 times a day, changing his catheter weekly.  Does have history of renal transplant, which has been followed by Dr. X and is on chronic steroids.  Renal ultrasound, June 23, 2008, was noted for mild hydronephrosis of renal transplant with fluid in the pericapsular space.  Creatinine, July 7, 2008 was 2.0, BUN 36, and patient tells me this is being followed by Dr. X.  No interval complaints today, no issues with catheterization or any gross hematuria.\n\nIMPRESSION:  \n1.  Neurogenic bladder, in a patient catheterizing himself 3 times a day, changing his catheter 3 times a week, we again reviewed the technique of catheterization, and he has no issues with this.\n2.  Recurrent urinary tract infection, in a patient who has been hospitalized twice within the last few months, he is on steroids for renal transplant, which has most likely been overall reducing his immune system.  He is asymptomatic today.  No complaints today.\n\nPLAN:  Following a detailed discussion with the patient, we elected to proceed with intermittent self-catheterization, changing catheter weekly, and technique has been discussed as above.  Based on the recent culture, we will place him on Keflex nighttime prophylaxis, for the next three months or so.  He will call if any concerns.  Follow up as previously scheduled in September for re-assessment.  All questions answered.  The patient is seen and evaluated by myself.

Bowel sounds present. Hepatomegaly with liver edge 3 cm below costal margin. Splenic tip palpable.\n\nRECTAL: Guaiac negative\n\nEXT: Shotty inguinal lymphadenopathy bilaterally, largest node 2cm\n\nNEURO: Strength 5/5 throughout, sensation intact, reflexes symmetric. No focal abnormality identified. No asterixis\n\nSKIN: Jaundice, no rash. No petechiae, gynecomastia or spider angiomata.\n\nHospital Course:\n\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital to begin workup of liver failure. Initial labs were considered to be consistent with an obstructive pattern, so further imaging was obtained. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed lymphadenopathy and a markedly enlarged liver. His abdominal pain was controlled with mild narcotics and he was noted to have decreasing jaundice by hospital day 4. An US guided liver biopsy revealed only acute granulomatous inflammation and fibrosis. The overall architecture of the liver was noted to be well preserved.\n\nGastroenterology was consulted for EGD and ERCP. The EGD was normal and the ERCP showed normal biliary anatomy without evidence of obstruction. In addition, they performed an endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of two lymph-nodes, one in the subcarinal region and one near the celiac plexus. Again, pathologic results were insufficient to make a tissue diagnosis.\n\nBy the second week of hospitalization, the patient was having intermittent low-grade fevers and again experiencing night-sweats. He remained jaundice. Given the previous negative biopsies, surgery was consulted to perform an excisional biopsy of the right groin lymph node, which revealed no evidence of carcinoma, negative AFB and GMS stains and a single noncaseating granuloma.\n\nBy his fourth week of hospitalization, he remained ill with evidence of ongoing liver failure. Surgery performed an open liver biopsy and lymph node resection.\n\nSTUDIES (HISTORICAL):\n\nCT abdomen: Multiple enlarged lymph nodes near the porta hepatis and peri-pancreatic regions. The largest node measures 3.5 x 3.0 cm. The liver is markedly enlarged (23cm) with a heterogenous pattern of enhancement. The spleen size is at the upper limit of normal. Pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys are within normal limits. Visualized portions of the lung parenchyma are grossly normal.\n\nCT neck: No abnormalities noted\n\nCT head: No intracranial abnormalities\n\nRUQ US (for biopsy): Heterogenous liver with lymphadenopathy.\n\nERCP: No filling defect noted; normal pancreatic duct visualized. Normal visualization of the biliary tree, no strictures. Normal exam.

Her outpatient evaluation revealed a mild-to-moderate cognitive linguistic deficit, which was completed approximately 2 months ago.  The patient had a history of hypertension and TIA/stroke.  The patient denied history of heartburn and/or gastroesophageal reflux disorder.  A modified barium swallow study was ordered to objectively evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety and to rule out aspiration.\n\nOBJECTIVE:  Modified barium swallow study was performed in the Radiology Suite in cooperation with Dr. ABC.  The patient was seated upright in a video imaging chair throughout this assessment.  To evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety, she was administered graduated amounts of liquid and food mixed with barium in the form of thin liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x2); nectar-thick liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x2); puree consistency (teaspoon x2); and solid food consistency (1/4 cracker x1).\n\nASSESSMENT\nORAL STAGE:  Premature spillage to the level of the valleculae and pyriform sinuses with thin liquid.  Decreased tongue base retraction, which contributed to vallecular pooling after the swallow.\n\nPHARYNGEAL STAGE:  No aspiration was observed during this evaluation.  Penetration was noted with cup sips of thin liquid only.  Trace residual on the valleculae and on tongue base with nectar-thick puree and solid consistencies.  The patient's hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movement are within functional limits.  Epiglottic inversion is within functional limits.\n\nCERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE:  The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.  Radiologist noted reduced peristaltic action of the constricted muscles in the esophagus, which may be contributing to the patient's complaint of globus sensation.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  No aspiration was noted during this evaluation.  Penetration with cup sips of thin liquid.  The patient did cough during this evaluation, but that was noted related to aspiration or penetration.\n\nPROGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: Based on this evaluation, the prognosis for swallowing and safety is good.\n\nPLAN:  Based on this evaluation and following recommendations are being made:\n1.  The patient to take small bite and small sips to help decrease the risk of aspiration and penetration.\n2.  The patient should remain upright at a 90-degree angle for at least 45 minutes after meals to decrease the risk of aspiration and penetration as well as to reduce her globus sensation.\n3.  The patient should be referred to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation of her esophageal function.\n\nThe patient does not need any skilled speech therapy for her swallowing abilities at this time, and she is discharged from my services.

She underwent a lipomyomeningocele repair at 3 days of age and then again at 3-1/2 years of age. \n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nREASON FOR VISIT:  The patient referred by Dr. X for evaluation of her possible tethered cord.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, she is a 14-year-old right handed female who is in 9th grade, who underwent a lipomyomeningocele repair at 3 days of age and then again at 3-1/2 years of age.  The last surgery was in 03/95.  She did well; however, in the past several months has had some leg pain in both legs out laterally, worsening at night and requiring Advil, Motrin as well as Tylenol PM.\n\nDenies any new bowel or bladder dysfunction or increased sensory loss.  She had some patchy sensory loss from L4 to S1.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Singulair for occasional asthma.\n\nFINDINGS:  She is awake, alert, and oriented x 3.  Pupils equal and reactive.  EOMs are full.  Motor is 5 out of 5.  She was able to toe and heel walk without any difficulties as well as tendon reflexes were 2 plus.  There is no evidence of clonus.  There is diminished sensation from L4 to S1, having proprioception.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Possible tethered cord.  I had a thorough discussion with the patient and her parents.  I have recommended a repeat MRI scan.  The prescription was given today.  MRI of the lumbar spine was just completed.  I would like to see her back in clinic.  We did discuss the possible symptoms of this tethering.

Baby boy has significant pulmonary hypertension.  \n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nINDICATION FOR CONSULTATION:  Increasing oxygen requirement.\n\nHISTORY:  Baby boy, XYZ, is a 29-3/7-week gestation infant.  His mother had premature rupture of membranes on 12/20/08.  She then presented to the Labor and Delivery with symptoms of flu.  The baby was then induced and delivered.  The mother had a history of premature babies in the past.  This baby was doing well, and then, we had a significant increasing oxygen requirement from room air up to 85%.  He is now on 60% FiO2.\n\nPHYSICAL FINDINGS\nGENERAL:  He appears to be pink, well perfused, and slightly jaundiced.\nVITAL SIGNS:  Pulse 156, 56 respiratory rate, 92% sat, and 59/28 mmHg blood pressure.\nSKIN:  He was pink.\n\nHe was on the high-frequency ventilator with good wiggle.\n\nHis echocardiogram showed normal structural anatomy.  He has evidence for significant pulmonary hypertension.  A large ductus arteriosus was seen with bidirectional shunt.  A foramen ovale shunt was also noted with bidirectional shunt.  The shunting for both the ductus and the foramen ovale was equal left to right and right to left.\n\nIMPRESSION:  My impression is that baby boy, XYZ, has significant pulmonary hypertension.  The best therapy for this is to continue oxygen.  If clinically worsens, he may require nitric oxide.  Certainly, Indocin should not be used at this time.  He needs to have lower pulmonary artery pressures for that to be considered.\n\nThank you very much for allowing me to be involved in baby XYZ's care.

It cleared for awhile.  This has been an intermittent problem.  Now it is back again on his right lower abdomen.  At first, it was thought that he may have early zoster.  This started six weeks before the holidays and is still going on, more so in the past eight days on his abdomen and right hip area.  He has had no treatment on this; there are no skin changes at all.  The patient bathes everyday but tries to use little soap.  The patient is married.  He works as an airplane mechanic.\n\nFAMILY, SOCIAL, AND ALLERGY HISTORY:  The patient has sinus and CVA.  He is a nonsmoker.  No known drug allergies.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Lipitor, aspirin, folic acid.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is well developed, appears stated age.  Overall health is good.  He does have psoriasis with some psoriatic arthritis, and his skin looks normal today.  On his trunk, he does have the hyperesthesia.  As you touch him, he winces.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Hyperesthesia, question etiology.\n\nTREATMENT:\n1.  Discussed condition and treatment with the patient.\n2.  Discontinue hot soapy water to these areas.\n3.  Increase moisturizing cream and lotion.\n4.  I referred him to Dr. ABC or Dr. XYZ for neurology evaluation.  We did not see anything on skin today.  Return p.r.n. flare.

He does have significant allergies including ragweed.  The drainage has been clear.  He had a little bit of a headache yesterday.  He has had no fever.  No one else is ill at home currently.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Advair and Allegra.  He has been taking these regularly.  He is not sure the Allegra is working for him anymore.  He does think though better than Claritin.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nGeneral:  Alert young man in no distress.\nHEENT:  TMs clear and mobile.  Pharynx clear.  Mouth moist.  Nasal mucosa pale with clear discharge.\nNeck:  Supple without adenopathy.\nHeart:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.\nLungs:  Lungs clear, no tachypnea, wheezing, rales or retractions.\nAbdomen:  Soft, nontender, without masses or splenomegaly.\n\nASSESSMENT:  I think this is still his allergic rhinitis rather than a sinus infection.\n\nPLAN:  Change to Zyrtec 10 mg samples were given.  He is not using nasal spray, but he has some at home.  He should restart this.  Continue to watch his peak flows to make sure his asthma does not come under poor control.  Call if any further problems.

She was 59 years old at the time and presented with a 6 month history of increasing irritability and left occipital-nuchal headaches. One month prior to that presentation she developed leftward head turning, and 3 days prior to presentation had an episode of severe dysphasia. A HCT (done locally) revealed a homogenously enhancing lesion of the left sphenoid wing. Skull X-rays showed deviation of the pineal to the right. She was transferred to UIHC and was noted to have a normal neurologic exam (per Neurosurgery note). Angiography demonstrated a highly vascular left temporal/sphenoid wing tumor. She under went left temporal craniotomy and &quot;complete resection&quot; of the tumor which on pathologic analysis was consistent with a meningioma.\n\nThe left sphenoid wing meningioma recurred and was excised 9/25/84. There was regrowth of this tumor seen on HCT, 1985. A 6/88 HCT revealed the left sphenoid meningioma and a new left tentorial meningioma. HCT in 1989 revealed left temporal/sphenoid, left tentorial, and new left frontal lesions. On 2/14/91 she presented with increasing lethargy and difficulty concentrating. A 2/14/91, HCT revealed increased size and surrounding edema of the left frontal meningioma. The left frontal and temporal meningiomas were excised on 2/25/91. These tumors all recurred and a left parietal lesion developed. She underwent resection of the left frontal meningioma on 11/21/91 due to right sided weakness and expressive aphasia. The weakness partially resolved and though the speech improved following resection it did not return to normal. In May 1992 she experienced 3 tonic-clonic type seizures, all of which began with a Jacksonian march up the RLE then RUE before generalizing. Her Phenobarbital prophylaxis which she had been taking since her 1980 surgery was increased. On 12/7/92, she underwent a left fronto-temporo-parieto-occipital craniotomy and excision of five meningiomas. Postoperatively she developed worsened right sided weakness and expressive aphasia. The weakness and aphasia improved by 3/93, but never returned to normal.

She suffers from morbid obesity.  She also has diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea.  She was evaluated in the Bariatric Surgical Center for placement of a band.  During her workup, she was noted to have evidence of cholelithiasis.  It was felt that the patient would benefit from removal of her gallbladder prior to having band placement secondary to her diabetes and the risk of infection of the band.  The patient was scheduled to undergo her procedure on 12/31/09; however, at blood glucose check, the patient was noted to be hyperglycemic, her sugar was 438.  She was admitted to the hospital for treatment of her hyperglycemia.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. ABC was admitted to the hospital.  She was seen by Dr. A.  He put her on an insulin drip.  Her sugars slowly did come down to normal down to between 115 and 134.  On the next day, she was then taken to the operating room, where she underwent her laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  She was noted to be a difficult intubation for the procedure.  There were some indications of chronic cholecystitis, a little bit of edema, mild edema and adhesions of omentum around the gallbladder.  She underwent the procedure.  She tolerated without difficulty.  She was recovered in the Postoperative Care Unit and then returned to the floor.  Her blood sugar postprocedure was noted to be 233.  She was started back on a sliding scale insulin.  She continued to do well and was felt to be stable for discharge following the procedure.\n\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  To return to the Medifast diet.  To continue with her blood glucose.  She needs to follow up with Dr. B, and she will see me next week on Friday.  We will determine if we will proceed with her lap band at that time.  She may shower.  She needs to keep her wounds clean and dry.  No heavy lifting.  No driving on narcotic pain medicines.  She needs to continue with her CPAP machine and continue to monitor her sugars.

He attempted to remove it with tweezers at home, but was unsuccessful.  He is requesting we attempt to remove this for him.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 72-year-old white male complaining of a wooden splinter lodged beneath his left fifth fingernail, sustained at 4 p.m. yesterday.  He attempted to remove it with tweezers at home, but was unsuccessful.  He is requesting we attempt to remove this for him.\n\nThe patient believes it has been over 10 years since his last tetanus shot, but states he has been allergic to previous immunizations primarily with &quot;horse serum.&quot;  Consequently, he has declined to update his tetanus immunization.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  He is currently on several medications, a list of which is attached to the chart, and was reviewed.  He is not on any blood thinners.\n\nALLERGIES:  HE IS ALLERGIC ONLY TO TETANUS SERUM.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is married and is a nonsmoker and lives with his wife.  \n\nNursing notes were reviewed with which I agree.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\nVITAL SIGNS:  Temp and vital signs are all within normal limits.\nGENERAL:  The patient is a pleasant elderly white male who is sitting on the stretcher in no acute distress.\nEXTREMITIES:  Exam of the left fifth finger shows a 5- to 6-mm splinter lodged beneath the medial aspect of the nail plate.  It does not protrude beyond the end of the nail plate.  There is no active bleeding.  There is no edema or erythema of the digit tip.  Flexion and extension of the DIP joint is intact.  The remainder of the hand is unremarkable.\n\nTREATMENT:  I did attempt to grasp the end of the splinter with splinter forceps, but it is brittle and continues to break off.  In order to better grasp the splinter, will require penetration beneath the nail plate, which the patient cannot tolerate due to pain.  Consequently, the base of the digit tip was prepped with Betadine, and just distal to the DIP joint, a digital block was applied with 1% lidocaine with complete analgesia of the digit tip.  I was able to grasp the splinter and remove this.  No further foreign body was seen beneath the nail plate and the area was cleansed and dressed with bacitracin and bandage.\n\nASSESSMENT:  Foreign body of the left fifth fingernail (wooden splinter).\n\nPLAN:  Patient was urged to clean the area b.i.d. with soap and water and to dress with bacitracin and a Band-Aid.  If he notes increasing redness, pain, or swelling, he was urged to return for re-evaluation.

This very independent 79-year old had struggled with cough, fevers, weakness, and chills for the week prior to admission.\n\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n-----\n\n\nADMISSION DIAGNOSES:\n1.  Pneumonia, failed outpatient treatment.\n2.  Hypoxia.\n3.  Rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\n1.  Atypical pneumonia, suspected viral.\n2.  Hypoxia.\n3.  Rheumatoid arthritis.\n4.  Suspected mild stress-induced adrenal insufficiency.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  This very independent 79-year old had struggled with cough, fevers, weakness, and chills for the week prior to admission.  She was seen on multiple occasions at Urgent Care and in her physician's office.  Initial x-ray showed some mild diffuse patchy infiltrates.  She was first started on Avelox, but had a reaction, switched to Augmentin, which caused loose stools, and then three days prior to admission was given daily 1 g Rocephin and started on azithromycin.  Her O2 saturations drifted downward.  They were less than 88% when active; at rest, varied between 88% and 92%.  Decision was made because of failed outpatient treatment of pneumonia.  Her medical history is significant for rheumatoid arthritis.  She is on 20 mg of methotrexate every week as well as Remicade every eight weeks.  Her last dose of Remicade was in the month of June.  Hospital course was relatively unremarkable.  CT scan was performed and no specific focal pathology was seen.  Dr. X, pulmonologist was consulted.  He also was uncertain as to the exact etiology, but viral etiology was most highly suspected.  Because of her loose stools, C. difficile toxin was ordered, although that is pending at the time of discharge.  She was continued on Rocephin IV and azithromycin.  Her fever broke 18 hours prior to discharge, and O2 saturations improved, as did her overall strength and clinical status.  She was instructed to finish azithromycin.  She has two pills left at home.  She is to follow up with Dr. X in two to three days.  Because she is on chronic prednisone therapy, it was suspected that she was mildly adrenal insufficient from the stress of her pneumonia.  She is to continue the increased dose of prednisone at 20 mg (up from 5 mg per day).  We will consult her rheumatologist as to whether to continue her methotrexate, which we held this past Friday.  Methotrexate is known on some occasions to cause pneumonitis.

He is complaining of left ear pain today.  He was treated on 04/14/2004, with amoxicillin for left otitis and Mom said he did seem to get better but just started complaining of the left ear pain today.  He has not had any fever but the congestion has continued to be very thick and purulent.  It has never really resolved.  He has a loose, productive-sounding cough but not consistently and not keeping him up at night.  No wheezing or shortness of breath.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  He has had some wheezing in the past but nothing recently.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  All siblings are on antibiotics for ear infections and URIs.\n\nOBJECTIVE:\nGeneral:  The patient is a 5-year-old male.  Alert and cooperative.  No acute distress.\nNeck:  Supple without adenopathy.\nHEENT:  Ear canals clear.  TMs, bilaterally, have distorted light reflexes but no erythema.  Gray in color.  Oropharynx pink and moist with a lot of postnasal discharge.  Nares are swollen and red.  Thick, purulent drainage.  Eyes are a little puffy.\nChest:  Respirations regular, nonlabored.\nLungs:  Clear to auscultation throughout.\nHeart:  Regular rhythm without murmur.\nSkin:  Warm, dry, pink.  Moist mucus membranes.  No rash.\n\nASSESSMENT:  Ongoing purulent rhinitis.  Probable sinusitis and serous otitis.\n\nPLAN:  Change to Omnicef two teaspoons daily for 10 days.  Frequent saline in the nose.  Also, there was some redness around the nares with a little bit of yellow crusting.  It appeared to be the start of impetigo, so hold off on the Rhinocort for a few days and then restart.  Use a little Neosporin for now.

We have done EMG studies.  He has noticed it since his stroke about five years ago.  He has been to see a neurologist.  We have tried different medications and it just does not seem to help.  He checks his blood sugars at home two to three times a day.  He kind of adjusts his own insulin himself.  Re-evaluation of symptoms is essentially negative.  He has a past history of heavy tobacco and alcohol usage.\n\nMEDICATIONS: Refer to chart.\n\nALLERGIES: Refer to chart.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: \nVitals: Wt; 118 lbs, B/P; 108/72, T; 96.5, P; 80 and regular.  \nGeneral:  A 70-year-old male who does not appear to be in acute distress but does look older than his stated age.  He has some missing dentition.\nSkin:  Dry and flaky. \nCV:  Heart tones are okay, adequate carotid pulsations.  He has 2+ pedal pulse on the left and 1+ on the right.\nLungs: Diminished but clear.\nAbdomen:  Scaphoid.\nRectal:  His prostate check was normal per Dr. Gill.\nNeuro:  Sensation with monofilament testing is better on the left than it is on the right.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1.  Diabetes mellitus.\n2.  Neuropathy.\n3.  Status post cerebrovascular accident.\n\nPLAN:  Refill his medications x 3 months.  We will check an A1c and BMP.  I have talked to him several times about a colonoscopy, which he has refused, and so we have been doing stools for occult blood.  We will check a PSA.  Continue with yearly eye exams, foot exams, Accu-Cheks, and we will see him in three months and p.r.n.
