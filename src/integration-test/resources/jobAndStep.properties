# the shutdownTimeout is the number of milliseconds the job should wait for
# the job to shut down correctly in the event of a manual stop. This timeout should be
# long enough for the current step to complete, so that other steps can be notified
# of the 'job stop' attempt and the job repository can be correctly updated.
# However, if the job hangs for unknown reasons, it's likely impossible to update the
# job repository successfully, meaning the current jobExecution will be in an unknown state.
